## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- Add Souk Compass indexing-pipeline integration coverage for language presets, root-scoped deduplication, boost-map search ordering, and Git-aware reindexing.
- Rosetta Stone deterministic canonical serializer with extra-field collision detection, YAML key-order normalization, and plan generation
- Implement deterministic inspection models in src/rosetta/inspection.ts
- Rosetta Stone immutable template bundle loader and pure renderer contract with in-memory Nunjucks rendering, content digest, and filesystem fallback prohibition
- Add acquisitions and translations profile records to ForgeConfigSchema with validation (Req 10.3-10.8, 13.12)
- Normalize legacy upstreams into typed acquisition/translation profiles (Req 10.6, 10.7, 13.12, 14.8)
- Tenant-scoped, durable memory records for Solr Compass: personal and org tenants with per-tenant collections, precedence-based conflict resolution, record supersession and retraction, validity windows, and configurable replication with backup and restore
- Implement deterministic pretty-printers for all source-capable format contracts (kiro-power, kiro-skill, superpowers, kiro-native, claude-code, codex, copilot, cursor, windsurf, cline, qdeveloper)
- Add Rosetta Stone target translators for Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and Q Developer
- Apply per-root boost maps to Souk Compass codebase search results
- Publish Solr Compass as a Bun-powered npm package with a pinned bunx launch, independent package and content roots, and patch-pinned SolrCloud images
- Add a Kiro Solr Compass Guided MCP Power artifact with seamless first-run Docker and SolrCloud initialization
- Document the shared Souk Compass indexing-policy architecture: centralized scanning, root-local configuration, language-aware chunking, client-side path boosting, and typed git-diff fallbacks.
- Implement target translators for Kiro, Claude Code, and Codex in src/rosetta/builtins/targets/
- Personal and organizational backup storage backends for Solr Compass: snapshots survive 'docker compose down -v' and rebuild, via a host-mounted local repository or a tenant's S3 bucket, with a portable snapshot manifest, an embedding-model compatibility guard, and a new compass_backup tool
- Add root-scoped deduplication property coverage for Souk Compass
- Use Git diffs to incrementally reindex changed Souk Compass codebase files, delete removed documents, and advance root commit metadata.
- Rosetta Stone source accounting and mapping helpers with consumed/preserved path tracking, field mappings, namespaced extra fields, and document order normalization
- Rosetta Stone built-in compatibility profiles seeded from ASSET_HARNESS_COMPATIBILITY and CAPABILITY_MATRIX with per-harness constants and lookup API
- Rosetta Stone transactional translation registry with atomic registration, frozen snapshots, and 12 built-in format contracts
- Rosetta Stone application policy evaluation and cross-request collision analysis with deterministic path normalization and configurable collision resolution
- Add shared format variant and option resolution module (src/rosetta/resolution.ts)
- Add Rosetta Stone public Zod schemas and inferred TypeScript types to src/schemas.ts covering format contracts, detection models, translation requests/results, diagnostics, compatibility profiles, plans, profiles, provenance, and machine-output envelopes
- Use Elixir-aware chunking when building Souk Compass codebase documents
- Add Rosetta Stone translation engine (src/rosetta/engine.ts) coordinating request guard, registry, detection, source translation, canonical validation, compatibility, target translation, and plan validation phases
- An 'aws' platform profile selecting Bedrock embeddings and S3 snapshot storage together with one shared region, and snapshot manifests moved onto Bun's Bun.file/S3File interface so local and S3 share one code path, the aws CLI becomes an optional fallback, and list finally sees snapshots in a bucket
- Add path-based source translators for kiro-power, kiro-skill, and superpowers formats under src/rosetta/builtins/sources/
- Rosetta Stone translation plan applier with atomic writes, symlink escape detection, collision rechecking, multi-file staging, and separate ApplicationReport
- Document root-scoped Git baselines for incremental Souk Compass indexing
- Store the current Git commit SHA on Souk Compass codebase index documents.
- Add harness-native source translators for Kiro, Claude Code, and Codex
- Add root-scoped content-hash deduplication to Souk Compass folder indexing.

### Changed
- Move the paid LLM eval suite to a manual-dispatch workflow and drop the redundant per-PR eval job from CI; the deterministic Kiro progressive-steering rubric stays a PR gate
- Refactor Souk Compass full-folder indexing to use shared language-aware scanning and root-local ignore rules.
- Deduplicate Souk Compass reindex chunks by root-scoped content hash before embedding and upserting.
- Refactor Souk Compass incremental reindexing to use the shared file scanner with project presets, explicit excludes, and `.solrcompass-ignore` rules.
- Upgrade TypeScript to 7.0.2 and bring kanon and souk-compass dependencies (biome, zod, chalk, promptfoo, clack, rollup, AWS SDK, MCP SDK, fast-check) up to date

### Deprecated
- Deprecate type: "power" as an asset-taxonomy value in favor of type: "skill" + harness-config.kiro.format: "power"; migrate all 47 existing power-typed artifacts

### Fixed
- Reconcile agent asset-type compatibility with per-harness agent capability support, make temper agent-degradation detection content-aware, and add agent validation rules


## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- Imported the Library AI Workshop facilitator, cohort, reference-interview, and research-output-review skills from eudaemon-ai/academic-ai-library-workshop, including their course references and simulated practice data, and exposed them through a dedicated catalog collection.
- kanon spec next command to atomically pull the next ready task for an agent
- Config-driven upstream marketplace sync with superpowers import format
- kanon spec now reads and writes Kiro's [~] in-progress checkbox marker in tasks.md, keeping claim/next/release/done in sync with COORDINATION.md
- Added an optional Souk Compass practice module for safe semantic-search retrieval evaluation
- kiro-specs skill for reading, writing, and executing Kiro Specs with multi-agent coordination
- Added Windows installation instructions for Bun alongside the existing macOS/Linux instructions in tutorial.md and self-paced-module.md, covering PowerShell, package managers (npm, Scoop, WinGet), and WSL options.
- Souk Compass supports Amazon Titan embeddings on Bedrock as a first-class provider, with connection reuse and retry for long reindexes, `embed_provider` recorded on every document, and a `providerMismatch` warning from `compass_status` when a collection was built by a different model.
- Souk Compass can pack artifact sections into larger chunks so each vector fills more of the embedding model's context window.
- Added the JHU Editorial Check skill as a Kanon knowledge artifact with bundled style, brand-asset, website-audit, scoring, checker, evaluation, and sample references.
- kanon spec channel alias and a Kirouija glossary for the multi-agent coordination protocol
- Progressive Steering for the Kiro harness: explicit `harness-config.kiro.inclusion` field with three-level resolver precedence (harness-config > top-level > default), build pipeline Kiro Inclusion Summary and configurable `alwaysWarnThreshold` warning, install pipeline `--max-always` gating with post-install summary, `<!-- forge:kiro-inclusion: ... -->` audit comment in emitted steering files, cross-field validation rules and progressive conventions in the validator, conditional Kiro inclusion prompt in the wizard, and a new `progressive-steering` eval rubric with six metrics (AOCW, PR, FMP, MD, DER, WCA).
- Add a generated skill-library index skill listing all installed plugin skills, reframe the kanon skill and plugin manifests to lead with the skill library.
- Souk Compass indexes more than one repository into the shared codebase collection. Documents record `index_root`, `compass_search_codebase` accepts a `root` filter and reports each hit's repository, the folder tools accept a `collection` override, `compass_setup` gains a `create_collection` action, and `compass_status` reports per-repository counts.
- kanon spec commands to coordinate multi-agent work on Kiro Specs via COORDINATION.md
- Per-harness body overrides: a `bodyOverrides` schema field, `body.<harness>.md` loading in the parser, a `resolveBody` helper, resolution in the compile pipeline, and generated plugin skills for powers.
- Task dependencies (_Depends:_) and claim leases for parallel multi-agent spec work

### Changed
- Refresh contributor guidance for current Kanon, curriculum, harness, and Souk Compass workflows
- Reclassify kanon guide as a skill so it ships as a discoverable Claude Code plugin skill
- Preserve nested and non-Markdown workflow reference files during parsing so imported skills retain their progressive-disclosure trees and simulated fixtures.
- Renamed codeshop to whetstone throughout, and community archon to codefactory.
- Souk Compass builds an ESM bundle to the tracked `bridge/mcp-server.mjs` instead of a gitignored `dist/`, so published releases carry a runnable server.
- Updated committed Claude plugin skill generation to create parent directories for nested workflow references.
- Expanded the Kanon curriculum for Johns Hopkins Libraries staff with accurate CLI exercises, safe practice content, assessments, a capstone rubric, and a coordinator guide
- Souk Compass fuses hybrid search scores on the client (ADR-0052). Solr rejects a `{!knn}` clause nested inside `{!func}`, so vector and keyword searches now run in parallel and merge locally. `SoukVectorClient.search()` accepts only `vector` and `keyword`. In hybrid mode `score` is a fused value normalized per request rather than a raw Solr score, so scores are not comparable across queries.

### Deprecated
- Deprecate type: "power" as an asset-taxonomy value in favor of type: "skill" + harness-config.kiro.format: "power"; migrate all 47 existing power-typed artifacts

### Fixed
- Souk Compass now honours the catalog's `path` field when reading artifacts. Deriving the path from the artifact name excluded every nested collection, leaving 42 of 63 artifacts absent from the index.
- Fix plugin install showing 0 skills — generate and commit real SKILL.md files for Claude Code discovery
- Souk Compass reported a healthy SolrCloud collection as missing, because cores are named `<collection>_shard1_replica_n1` rather than after the collection.
- Souk Compass fails loudly when a configured embedding provider cannot start, instead of silently falling back to a different model and embedding queries in the wrong vector space.
- `compass_search` no longer fails in its default mode, which is hybrid.
- Souk Compass failed to connect with JSON-RPC error -32000 when installed as a plugin, because no build artifact was published.
- The Souk Compass embedding cache is keyed by provider and dimensionality. Keyed on text alone, switching providers served the previous model's vectors — meaningless similarity scores with nothing to indicate it.
- Reconcile agent asset-type compatibility with per-harness agent capability support, make temper agent-degradation detection content-aware, and add agent validation rules
- Every vector and hybrid search failed with HTTP 414 because a 1024-dimension query vector exceeds Jetty's default 8 KB header limit. The Solr container now raises `solr.jetty.request.header.size`, and searches POST their parameters.
- Souk Compass silently dropped roughly half of all indexed documents. A long numeric token in a vector triggered a Solr ClassCastException when it landed on a JSON parser buffer boundary; vector components are now rounded before transmission, which loses no precision the 7-bit quantised field would have kept.
- Souk Compass scopes `clear` and incremental reindex to the folder being indexed. Both previously deleted documents belonging to other indexed repositories.
- Stale codeshop references after the whetstone rename, and CodeQL findings for incomplete string escaping and an unused loop iteration variable.


## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- Added Codex plugin packaging and hardened Codex harness output, including plugin manifest metadata, MCP config generation/import, native skill output, hook degradation warnings, and bundled bridge/catalog release assets.
- skill-forge power brought to parity with adr: now a source-generated knowledge artifact (knowledge/skill-forge) using the lean Kiro power flags, with License/Privacy/Support metadata, MIT license, jh-drcc collection correction, and eval coverage
- Kiro adapter: per-artifact harness-config.kiro flags inline-workflows and main-steering to emit lean, official-format powers (POWER.md + steering only, no inlined duplication or {name}.md duplicate)
- ADR-0044: propose renaming Kanon to Kanon (κανών)
- Expand alice-whiterabbit knowledge with doi-minting, preservation, and tutorials workflows
- archon-reference-pack knowledge artifact and archon collection
- Add Getting Started docs for project users, guild members, and skill-forge contributors

### Changed
- Renamed from Skill Forge to Kanon
- ADR power prepared for official Kiro power submission: lean Kiro-optimized POWER.md, hooks delivered as installable native v2 JSON in steering/hooks.md (no shipped .kiro.hook files), License/Privacy/Support metadata, and license corrected to MIT
- Upgrade Souk Compass to Solr 10 with scalar-quantized dense vectors and ACORN filtered search
- Eval suite improvements: fixed infra (cost→latency), realism (inline context for tool-less evals), content (mandatory first-response directives), and keyword alignment across codeshop, secure-by-default, and adr artifacts

### Fixed
- Kiro adapter now emits description field in steering frontmatter for progressive steering compatibility


### Added
- Added Codex plugin packaging and hardened Codex harness output, including `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, Codex-safe MCP config, native skill output checks, Codex importer coverage, and bundled MCP bridge/catalog release assets.

### Changed
- **Renamed from Skill Forge to Kanon.** The CLI, package, and all references now use the new name.

  **Migration guide for existing users:**
  - **CLI**: `forge` → `kanon` (the old `forge` command still works with a deprecation warning for one release)
  - **Config**: `forge.config.yaml` → `kanon.config.yaml` (old name still works with a deprecation warning)
  - **Package**: `@thinkingsage/skill-forge` → `@thinkingsage/kanon`
  - **Directory**: `skill-forge/` → `kanon/`

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- Add 4 eval dimensions: negative routing disambiguation (`not-icontains` on 10 routing tests), temperature sensitivity (7 tests at temp 0.3), prompt efficiency (4 tests with `cost` assertions at $0.10 threshold), and scenario-based shared concept adherence (7 tests covering vertical slices, deep modules, durable issues, contract-first, checksum discipline, domain language).
- Hash-based deep links in browse SPA — artifacts are now bookmarkable and shareable via `#artifact/<name>` URL fragments. Browser back/forward navigation supported.
- Codeshop skill #21: `migrate` — reliable data migration with checksum verification across 5 phases (Inventory, Plan, Dry-Run, Execute, Verify). Adds Migration Checksum Discipline shared concept and Migration Chain to workflow composition.
- Add `--record` and `--trend` flags to `forge eval` for evolutionary prompt improvement tracking. `--record` appends per-run scores to `evals/history.jsonl`; `--trend` prints a table with sparkline showing score progression over time.
- Upgrade Souk Compass from Solr 9 to Solr 10 with scalar quantized dense vectors (~4x memory reduction), ACORN filtered search support, and enhanced kNN query parameters. Requires reindexing after upgrade.
- New `release-manager` companion power — tool-agnostic release lifecycle management with 4-phase cut-release workflow (Assess, Draft, Cut, Announce). Multi-harness support. Detects whatever release tooling the project uses.
- Multi-turn workflow evals for `integrate` (5 tests) and `migrate` (5 tests) simulating phase progression with deterministic + semantic assertions. Chain transition evals (5 tests) verifying correct next-workflow suggestions. Deterministic `icontains` assertions added to all 14 routing eval tests. All evals upgraded from Claude Sonnet 4 to Claude Sonnet 4.6.
- Codeshop skill #20: `integrate` — wire external systems through contract-first adapters with 5-phase workflow (Discover, Contract, Wire, Harden, Verify). Adds Contract-First Integration shared concept and Integration Chain to workflow composition.
- New `secure-by-default` companion power — STRIDE threat modeling, auth/authz flow review, and secure coding reference (OWASP, input validation, secret hygiene). Multi-harness support. User-invoked only.
- Structural validation tests for codeshop workflow phase sequencing, chain validity, and entry/exit criteria alignment — 11 tests covering dangling references, linear phase ordering, orphan detection, chain-to-router consistency, and phase numbering.

### Changed
- Revised ADR power (v0.4.0): expanded troubleshooting section, added configuration section, broadened changelog tool detection guidance, improved steering file descriptions with when-to-use context, added hook portability notes.
- Bump promptfoo dependency from ^0.121.5 to ^0.121.9.
- Remove `dist/` and `catalog.json` from git tracking. Both are now gitignored and built fresh in CI — dist is uploaded as a CI artifact on every PR and attached as a tarball to GitHub Releases. The `dist-drift` workflow is removed.

### Fixed
- Place forge:version comment after YAML frontmatter instead of before it, fixing Kiro power metadata parsing
- Fix codeshop frontmatter: `name` field to lowercase `codeshop`, keyword `codebase-architecture` to `architecture`. Fix CategoryEnum test to include `writing` category (10 categories).


## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- Added MCP bridge compilation smoke test to CI (`bun run build:bridge` + `node bridge/mcp-server.cjs --version`)
- Added ADR-0031 documenting Souk Compass as a standalone MCP server for Solr-backed semantic search with pluggable embedding providers and multi-tier caching.
- ADR-0030: authoring-level version embedding and manifests
- Multi-harness `forge import --harness` command supporting all 7 harness-native formats (Kiro, Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Q Developer) with auto-detection, --force, and --dry-run
- Admin UI components in Browse SPA: capability badges with color-coded matrix grid, inline temper preview panel, import modal with file scanner, version display with upgrade button, workspace tab with project management, interactive dependency graph (inline SVG with force-directed layout), and build dashboard with config persistence and history
- Interactive `forge temper` command for previewing the compiled AI experience per artifact-harness pair, with terminal output, JSON mode, side-by-side comparison (--compare), and web preview (--web)
- Admin API endpoints for capabilities (GET /api/capabilities), temper (POST /api/temper), import scan/execute (POST /api/import), versions/upgrade (GET/POST /api/versions, /api/upgrade), workspace (GET/PUT /api/workspace), dependency graph (GET /api/graph), and build trigger/status (POST /api/build, GET /api/build/status)
- Comprehensive unit test suite for Souk Compass MCP server — 191 tests across 9 files covering SoukVectorClient, embedding provider factory, tool handlers, MCP error boundary, CachedEmbeddingProvider, chunker, serialization, workspace profiler, and hook/plugin validation.
- Added `changelog-check` CI job that enforces a changelog fragment exists for PRs touching source files, with `skip-changelog` label escape hatch
- Added daily `dist-drift.yml` scheduled workflow that rebuilds artifacts and MCP bridge on `main` and warns if `dist/` or `bridge/` have drifted from source
- Harness capability matrix declaring support levels (full/partial/none) for 8 capabilities across all 7 harnesses, with configurable degradation strategies (inline/comment/omit) applied automatically during build
- Added promptfoo eval suites for codeshop (routing, skill-quality, shared-concepts), all 8 byron-powers artifacts, ADR (workflow-correctness, template-quality, generate-from-diff, health-check), and karpathy-mode (principle-enforcement, tradeoff-awareness) — 71 tests total
- Multi-repo and monorepo workspace support via forge.config.yaml with multiple knowledge sources, per-project harness/artifact configuration, workspace-aware build and install, and --project flag
- Artifact versioning with semver version embedding in compiled output, .forge-manifest.json sidecar files, `forge upgrade` command with migration script support, --force, and --dry-run

### Changed
- Updated README with complete CLI command reference, project structure, capability matrix, and development instructions
- Trimmed knowledge artifact keywords to 6-19 per artifact, removed keyword/category overlaps, established canonical 10-category taxonomy, and added 'writing' to CategoryEnum in schemas.ts
- Added Bun dependency caching (`~/.bun/install/cache` + `node_modules`) keyed on `bun.lock` hash to all GitHub Actions workflows (CI, release, audit, pages)
- Added event-driven hooks to five neon-caravan artifacts (commit-craft, review-ritual, type-guardian, debug-journal, karpathy-mode) and added missing Overview, Examples, and Troubleshooting sections to all knowledge artifacts per Kiro Power best practices.
- Switched Souk Compass local Solr from standalone mode to SolrCloud (1 node + ZooKeeper), enabling the Collections API for programmatic collection management and configset-based schema deployment. Updated health check to use ping endpoint for mode-agnostic operation.
- Added Overview, Examples, Troubleshooting, and Steering Files listing sections to all eight byron-powers artifacts (novelist, fantasy-novelist, scifi-novelist, mystery-series-novelist, series-continuity, book-agent-publicist, technical-author, proofreader-review-checklist) per Kiro Power best practices.
- Updated the Hello test artifact with a fun onboarding section that greets users in 20 languages and bumped version to 0.2.0.
- Split CI into parallel jobs (`lint-and-typecheck`, `test`, `validate-and-build`) so lint, tests, and artifact validation run concurrently
- Added `concurrency` group with `cancel-in-progress: true` to CI so rapid pushes to a PR cancel stale in-progress runs
- Rewrote top-level README with current collection counts, full repo structure, and complete Quick Start
- Replaced stub skill-forge CONTRIBUTING with code-level guide covering module map, adapter/backend patterns, testing conventions, and common pitfalls
- Overhauled CLI help metadata with thorough examples, option groups, and coverage for all commands including catalog export, guild, and collection
- Updated the knowledge.md scaffold template to include skeleton Overview, Best Practices, Examples, and Troubleshooting sections so new artifacts start with the recommended Kiro Power structure.

### Fixed
- Fixed the CI eval job to use the eval suite's Bedrock credentials, and skip forked pull request runs where the required secrets are unavailable.
- Fixed all Biome lint errors and TypeScript type-check failures: resolved Bun Dirent type incompatibility in versioning.ts, tightened mapKiroEvent return type to CanonicalEvent, added missing changelog/migrations fields to CatalogEntry test factories, added buildHistory to BrowseState test fixtures, removed unused imports, applied Biome formatting, and suppressed intentional ANSI escape regex checks
- Updated GitHub workflows to install Node 22 and run repository automation from the `skill-forge` directory so CI, audit, CodeQL, and release jobs target the actual project files.
- Fixed SQLite BLOB deserialization in CachedEmbeddingProvider — Bun's bun:sqlite returns Uint8Array for BLOB columns, now uses TextDecoder instead of toString() for correct embedding recovery.
- Removed hardcoded test count from PR template checklist to prevent staleness
- Static catalog export: use replacer function in generateStaticHtmlPage to prevent String.replace dollar-sign corruption of embedded JSON


## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Added manifest entry management to `forge catalog browse` — view manifest entries with sync status indicators, add/edit/remove entries via REST API (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/manifest/entries`), and display synced/outdated/missing status from sync-lock comparison
- Added 4 property-based tests for collection admin correctness (Properties 10–12, 16) — YAML round-trip, unknown key preservation, validation consistency, and filtering correctness.
- Added unit tests for `manifest-admin.ts` — 9 tests covering `readManifest`, `readSyncLock`, `computeSyncStatus` (synced/outdated/missing), and error paths for `addManifestEntry`, `editManifestEntry`, `removeManifestEntry`.
- Added collection management to `forge catalog browse` — list, view, create, edit, and delete collection YAML files via REST API (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/collections`) with trust-level and tag filtering in the UI
- Added 9 property-based tests for artifact admin correctness (Properties 1–9) — frontmatter serialization round-trip, validation consistency, kebab-case enforcement, file structure verification, update preservation, delete removal, catalog consistency, toKebabCase output, and comma-separated parsing.
- Added unit tests for `admin.ts` — 20 tests covering `serializeFrontmatter`, `validateArtifactInput`, `toKebabCase`, and error paths for `createArtifact`, `updateArtifact`, `deleteArtifact`.
- Added unit tests for `collection-admin.ts` — 15 tests covering `parseCollectionFile`, `serializeCollection`, `validateCollectionInput`, `getCollection` member resolution, and error paths for CRUD operations.
- Documented browse UI module extraction architecture (ADR-0025).
- Added 30 integration tests for browse server mutation endpoints — artifact/collection/manifest CRUD round-trips, sync status verification, Content-Type validation, and structured error responses (400/404/409).
- Added tab navigation (Artifacts | Collections | Manifest) to `forge catalog browse` with a shared UI design system including design tokens, reusable card/form/badge/toast/modal components, and context-aware create buttons
- Added full CRUD capabilities to `forge catalog browse` for knowledge artifacts — create, edit, and delete artifacts directly from the browser UI via `POST /api/artifact`, `PUT /api/artifact/:name`, and `DELETE /api/artifact/:name` endpoints with validation, conflict detection, and automatic catalog refresh
- Added 3 property-based tests for manifest admin correctness (Properties 13–15) — sync status computation, entry validation delegation, and top-level field preservation during mutations.
- Extract browse UI template (`generateHtmlPage`, `generateStaticHtmlPage`, `escapeHtml`) into dedicated `browse-ui.ts` module, reducing `browse.ts` from ~2950 to ~500 lines (ADR-0025).
- Documented browse server admin CRUD architecture with mutable state wrapper and modular admin layers (ADR-0024)

### Fixed
- Fix GitHub Pages workflow to deploy from `jhu-main` instead of `main` so the catalog browser shows all knowledge artifacts


## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Added `src/asset-conventions.ts` registry mapping each of the 8 asset types to required files, optional files, and type-specific validation rule keys
- Added `forge import <path> [--all] [--format] [--dry-run] [--collections]` command for ingesting external Kiro powers (`POWER.md` + `steering/`) and skills (`SKILL.md` + `references/`) into the skill-forge knowledge directory
- Added forge tutorial command providing a step-by-step guided walkthrough for first-time users covering artifact creation via the interactive wizard, generated file exploration, and building with progress indicators and jargon-free language
- Auto-fetch from configured backend when artifact or collection is not in global cache (guild init)
- Added maturity badge, trust lane label, and maturity filter to catalog browser card and detail views in `forge catalog browse`
- Add jhu collection and backend (jhu-sheridan-libraries/agentic-skill-forge)
- Documented decision to use an auto-detecting multi-format importer for `forge import` over a hardcoded single-format path, enabling extensibility to future source formats without CLI surface changes (ADR-0019)
- Implemented Kiro harness adapter with steering files, hook JSON, POWER.md, spec-hooks, and MCP config generation
- Added `hello-world` example power and full `kiro-official` collection knowledge definitions covering 26 powers:

- `arm-soc-migration`
- `aws-agentcore`
- `aws-amplify`
- `aws-devops-agent`
- `aws-healthomics`
- `aws-infrastructure-as-code`
- `aws-mcp`
- `aws-observability`
- `aws-sam`
- `checkout-api-reference`
- `cloud-architect`
- `cloudwatch-application-signals`
- `datadog`
- `dynatrace`
- `figma`
- `gcp-aws-migrate`
- `graviton-migration-power`
- `neon`
- `postman`
- `power-builder`
- `saas-builder`
- `spark-troubleshooting-agent`
- `stackgen`
- `strands`
- `stripe`
- `terraform`
- Added forge catalog browse subcommand with local web-based catalog browser featuring search, harness/type/category filtering, and artifact detail view with knowledge.md preview
- Added AssetTypeSchema expanding the `type` field to 8 values (skill, power, rule, workflow, agent, prompt, template, reference-pack) as a semantic asset taxonomy, with ArtifactTypeSchema kept as a backward-compatible alias
- Implemented forge new scaffolding command with template-driven artifact creation
- Added DevSecOps GitHub Actions workflows: CodeQL static analysis (src/ and bridge/ with security-extended queries), scheduled dependency audit with bun audit and Gitleaks secret scanning (custom rules for mcp-servers.yaml env blocks), OSSF Scorecard, Dependabot weekly updates, path-based PR labeler, and stale issue management
- Implemented Nunjucks template engine module with inheritance support and custom filters
- Added --yes flag to forge new command to skip the interactive wizard and use template defaults for CI and scripting use cases
- Added `forge help [command]` subcommand as an alternative to --help, with contextual command help and unknown command error handling
- Added context-bazaar Claude Code plugin packaging with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.mcp.json`, and a bundled MCP bridge (`bridge/mcp-server.cjs`) exposing `catalog_list`, `artifact_content`, and `collection_list` tools
- Added styled help screens with chalk color styling, aligned command tables, per-command usage examples, grouped options, and --no-color support via a pure-function Help_Renderer module
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md covering artifact scaffolding, frontmatter fields, quality bar, collection assignment, import workflow, development commands, changelog fragment process, and pull request checklist
- Added `forge.config.yaml` per-repo configuration and `~/.forge/config.yaml` user-global configuration loaded via `src/config.ts`; declares named install backends, publish target, and governance author allowlists
- Added asset type select prompt to the `forge new` interactive wizard with descriptions for all 8 asset types; prompt is skipped when `--type` is passed on the command line
- Added harness-specific emoji icons to the catalog browser filter checkboxes, card footer, and detail view (👻 kiro, 🤖 claude-code, 🐙 copilot, 🖱️ cursor, 🏄 windsurf, 🔧 cline, ☁️ qdeveloper)
- Added ecosystem, depends, and enhances metadata fields to frontmatter and catalog schemas with kebab-case validation
- Documented decision to declare collection membership in artifact frontmatter rather than in collection manifests, with four alternatives considered and rationale for eliminating the two-source-of-truth problem (ADR-0016)
- Documented decision to use a pre-bundled MCP server as the Claude Code plugin integration layer over pure skill file distribution or a slash command, enabling interactive parameterised catalog queries from inside the assistant (ADR-0020)
- Added `--strict` flag to `forge build` that treats compatibility warnings (partial or missing harness support for an asset type) as hard errors
- Documented decision to use the `gh` CLI rather than direct GitHub REST API calls for release creation and asset download, delegating auth management to an already-installed tool (ADR-0018)
- Added CollectionSchema for metadata-only collection manifests in `collections/*.yaml`; collection membership is declared by artifacts in their own frontmatter via `collections: [name]` rather than listed in the manifest, eliminating stale cross-references
- Added multi-root source scanning so `forge build`, `forge validate`, and `forge catalog generate` scan both `knowledge/` and `packages/` directories, skipping roots that do not exist
- Added `src/collections.ts` with `loadCollections`, `validateArtifactCollectionRefs`, and `buildCollectionMembership` for loading collection manifests, cross-validating artifact collection references, and computing derived membership maps
- Added `forge publish` command running the full pipeline (validate --strict, build, catalog, release-manifest.json, per-harness tarballs) and publishing via `gh release create` for GitHub or `aws s3 sync` for S3; `--dry-run` packages without uploading
- Added pluggable backend abstraction in `src/backends/` with a shared `ArtifactBackend` interface and four implementations: `LocalBackend` (filesystem), `GitHubBackend` (gh CLI), `S3Backend` (aws CLI, compatible with R2/MinIO), and `HttpBackend` (generic HTTPS with bearer token support)
- Added asset × harness compatibility matrix in `src/compatibility.ts` so `forge build` skips type/harness combinations with no meaningful output and emits partial-support warnings for degraded combinations
- Documented decision to use a pluggable ArtifactBackend interface over hardcoding GitHub as the only install/publish target, enabling private S3 and HTTP backends alongside the public GitHub releases backend (ADR-0017)
- Implemented Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and Q Developer harness adapters
- Documented decision to add `--security` flag to `forge validate` over a standalone command or CI-only approach, integrating prompt injection, hook exfiltration, and MCP surface checks as a local-and-CI gate (ADR-0021)
- Added `--backend <name>` flag to `forge install` for fetching artifacts from a named backend declared in `forge.config.yaml`; enables installing from private S3 buckets and HTTP endpoints alongside the existing `--from-release` GitHub path
- Added file-writer module with buildKnowledgeMd, buildHooksYaml, buildMcpServersYaml, and writeWizardResult functions for serializing wizard output to gray-matter markdown and YAML files
- Added `collections` field to artifact frontmatter and catalog entries so artifacts declare their own collection membership; the catalog derives collection membership from artifact metadata rather than from a separate member list
- Added governance lane validation warnings: `trust: official` or `partner` without a `license` field, `risk-level: high` without a `trust` lane, and artifacts declaring a collection name with no matching manifest in `collections/`
- Added CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md addressing contributor responsibility in the AI harness era: curated vs. uncurated AI-assisted contributions, knowledge quality standards, attribution policy, and the expectation that all submitted content has been reviewed and understood by its author
- Added four seed knowledge artifacts to the Neon Caravan collection: `commit-craft` (prompt), `type-guardian` (skill), `debug-journal` (workflow with three phase files), and `review-ritual` (skill)
- Added `forge collection build` subcommand and `src/collection-builder.ts` that assembles per-collection dist bundles at `dist/<harness>/collections/<name>/` by merging pre-built member artifact outputs derived from catalog collection membership
- Added category taxonomy (CategoryEnum) with 9 initial values for tagging knowledge artifacts by domain
- Added generated `dist/` artifacts for kiro, claude-code, and copilot harnesses covering all power definitions including kiro-official, byron-powers, hello-world, and adr collections
- Added `karpathy-mode` knowledge entry (Andrej Karpathy's behavioral coding guidelines) with kiro and claude-code harness targets, examples workflow, MIT license, and upstream provenance tracking
- Added cross-artifact dependency reference validation with warnings for unresolved depends/enhances references
- Implemented Claude Code adapter with CLAUDE.md, Stop hooks in settings.json, and MCP config
- Added Collection filter group to `forge catalog browse` UI so users can browse artifacts scoped to a single collection; filter group is hidden when no artifacts have collection membership
- Added GitHub issue templates for artifact submission (identity table, content preview, quality self-assessment) and content quality report (exact-quote requirement, severity taxonomy, fix capacity check)
- Implemented eval framework with discovery, prompt resolver, harness context wrapping, promptfoo integration, and scaffold command
- Added interactive wizard to forge new command using @clack/prompts for guided artifact configuration including frontmatter metadata, knowledge body, hooks, and MCP server definitions with inline Zod validation and cancellation safety
- Added download cache at `~/.forge/cache/<backend>/<artifact>@<version>/` so remote backend artifacts (GitHub releases, S3, HTTP) are not re-downloaded on repeated installs
- Added `.forge-manifest.json` written alongside installed artifacts recording artifact name, harness, version, backend label, and install timestamp to enable future upgrade tracking
- Added enhanced version output with Bun runtime version and OS platform info to `forge --version`
- Verified CLI entry point with all six commands wired and functional
- Added root-level CLAUDE.md providing Claude Code with commands, architecture overview, compile pipeline, type system, collection model, MCP bridge details, test helper conventions, and changelog/ADR discipline
- Added asset-type-aware validation warnings to `forge validate`: `reference-pack` without `inclusion: manual`, `workflow` with empty or missing `workflows/` directory, and `prompt` with a body shorter than 50 characters
- Added `--type <type>` flag to `forge new` for pre-selecting the asset type and bypassing the wizard type prompt; validates against the 8-value AssetTypeSchema and scaffolds type-appropriate structure (e.g. `workflow` pre-creates `workflows/main.md`)
- Added typo suggestion for unknown commands using Levenshtein distance (fastest-levenshtein), suggesting the closest match when distance ≤ 2
- Implemented catalog generation with generateCatalog, serializeCatalog, and catalogCommand
- Added namespaced artifact layout support for `packages/@org/<artifact>/knowledge.md` alongside the existing flat `knowledge/<artifact>/knowledge.md` layout; dist output paths always use the leaf artifact name
- Add --backend option to guild init for specifying a named backend
- Added CLI startup banners: full-color gradient banner with dark navy background for interactive use, and plain-text logBanner() export for log files
- Added `forge collection new [name]` interactive wizard for scaffolding collection manifests; changed `forge collection` bare invocation to show a status overview with member counts and an interactive "create first collection?" prompt when none exist
- Added three ADR power hooks (agent-stop reminder, pre-task ADR listing, post-task diff summary) and updated ADR knowledge metadata with `harness-config` and corrected author field
- Implemented install module with direct CLI install, interactive wizard using clack/prompts, and installCommand handler
- Added bazaar governance and discovery fields to artifact frontmatter and catalog entries: `maturity`, `trust`, `risk-level`, `audience`, `model-assumptions`, `id`, `license`, `successor`, and `replaces`, all optional with safe defaults so existing artifacts require no changes
- Documented decision to combine static pattern matching with LLM adversarial rubric evals as a two-layer artifact security review, using the existing promptfoo eval infrastructure against compiled CLAUDE.md artifacts (ADR-0022)
- Implemented build orchestrator with full and single-harness build, shared MCP server resolution, and CLI handler
- Added `harness-config` field (with `kiro.format: "power"`) to `importKiroPower` frontmatter output so imported powers carry their format declaration forward
- Implemented parser module with parseKnowledgeMd, parseHooksYaml, parseMcpServersYaml, parseWorkflows, and loadKnowledgeArtifact
- Implemented validation module with validateArtifact, validateAll, and validateCommand CLI handler
- Verified and completed Zod schemas in src/schemas.ts with all required schemas, types, and passthrough support
- Added biome.json config scoping lint to src/, scripts/, evals/, and collections/, excluding generated files (bridge/, coverage/, dist/, .forge/, upstream/, catalog.json)
- Implemented Copilot adapter with instructions, path-scoped files, and AGENTS.md generation
- Added dependency composition for `workflow` and `agent` artifact types: MCP servers from `depends` artifacts are merged before compilation, and hooks are merged when `inherit-hooks: true` is set in the artifact's frontmatter
- Added `kiro-official.yaml` collection manifest, `sync-kiro-powers.sh` script for pulling upstream power sources, and `upstream/.gitkeep` placeholder directory
- Added dependency cycle detection to `forge validate` using DFS over the `depends` graph; cycles now produce hard validation errors identifying the full cycle path

### Changed
- Changed detail view to merge redundant Harnesses and Formats sections into a single Targets section showing icon, harness name, and format inline; improved back-to-catalog button with pill styling and animated arrow
- Changed writing-related power knowledge (novelist, technical-author, proofreader-review-checklist, book-agent-publicist, scifi-novelist, fantasy-novelist, mystery-series-novelist, series-continuity) to live under `knowledge/byron-powers/` namespace with new hooks and workflow content
- Expanded SECURITY.md with MCP bridge attack surface documentation, distinction between security issues and content quality issues, coordinated disclosure timeline, and in-scope vs. out-of-scope table
- Updated forge new scaffold template to include categories, ecosystem, depends, and enhances fields with guiding YAML comments
- Changed eval output formatting to use horizontal rules, filled progress bars, tree connectors (├─/╰─) for response and grading reason detail lines, and suppressed noisy GCP metadata probe warnings from promptfoo
- Changed root help screen to display subcommands indented under their parent commands (catalog, collection) in a structured hierarchy; stripped `[options]` noise from command names at the overview level
- Expanded pull request template with artifact changes table, breaking changes callout, split checklist (Code / Artifacts / Housekeeping), harness output preview command, and structured prompting to prevent empty sections
- Changed `maturity: deprecated` without a `successor` field from a validation warning to a validation error, enforcing that deprecated artifacts always point to their replacement
- Changed banner display logic to suppress on --help, -h, and `forge help` invocations, showing only on bare `forge` with no arguments
- Changed the type-field deprecation warning to a lifecycle warning emitted during `forge validate` when an artifact has `maturity: deprecated` but no `successor` field set
- Changed `forge new` scaffold template to include commented-out bazaar metadata stubs (maturity, trust, license, audience, risk-level, model-assumptions) so authors can see available fields without being required to fill them in
- Changed catalog browser to registry-style card hierarchy with display name, monospace package name, 2-line description, pill keywords, and icon-only harness footer; added Space Grotesk display font and Inter body font; improved filter bar with labeled groups and pill-style checkboxes

### Deprecated
- Deprecated `BuildOptions.knowledgeDir` (singular string) in favor of `BuildOptions.knowledgeDirs: string[]` to support multi-root scanning; the old field is still accepted but will be removed in a future version

### Fixed
- Fixed trailing `help` on CLI commands (e.g. `forge build help`, `forge catalog browse help`) now showing the help screen instead of erroring with "too many arguments"
- Fixed type errors across source and test files for strict TypeScript compliance — added missing collections/inherit-hooks fields, corrected Dirent typing for Node.js compatibility, and resolved narrowing issues in tests
- Fixed wizard validateField returning parsed string values as error messages, causing text prompts to mirror input instead of proceeding
- GitHubBackend fetchArtifact tarball extraction double-nesting (harness prefix already in archive)
- Fixed `forge import` crashing on non-artifact directories by verifying `POWER.md` / `SKILL.md` existence before dispatching, and filtering out dot-directories (`.github`, `.kiro`, etc.) during source scanning
- Fixed `forge tutorial` crashing on re-run when the hello-world artifact already exists by removing the existing directory before re-scaffolding when the user confirms overwrite
- GitHubBackend fetchArtifact directory existence check (Bun.file().exists() does not work on directories)
- Fixed CLI banner right edge so all lines render as a uniform rectangle by computing visual terminal column width (handling wide emoji including ⚡) and normalising trailing padding dynamically rather than hardcoding it per line
- Global install version selection now picks newest release instead of oldest
- GitHubBackend fetchCatalog now uses gh release download instead of broken gh api path
- Fixed build.ts resolveComposition destructuring that referenced a nonexistent `resolved` property, causing a type error and potential runtime failure


### Architecture Decisions

- [ADR-009](docs/adr/0009-clack-prompts-for-interactive-cli.md): Use @clack/prompts for interactive CLI flows
- [ADR-010](docs/adr/0010-scaffold-first-overwrite-on-success.md): Scaffold-first, overwrite-on-success pattern for interactive wizard

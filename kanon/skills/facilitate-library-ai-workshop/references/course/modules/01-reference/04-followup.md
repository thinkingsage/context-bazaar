    instruction: "Turn the scoped work into a concise patron-facing message."
    prompt_text: |
      Draft a 180-220 word follow-up email to the faculty member. Summarize how the question has been scoped, list the next three librarian actions, identify the ambiguity we still need them to resolve, and offer a non-AI consultation path. Do not claim that a search has already been completed.
    checkpoint: "The email is clear about what has and has not happened."

    type: "prompt"
    instruction: "Practice concise, locally adaptable disclosure."
    prompt_text: |
      Add one plain-language sentence disclosing that the AI tool used in this workshop helped organize the de-identified request and that a librarian will verify the search strategy and sources. Do not name a product unless local policy requires it.
    checkpoint: "The disclosure is specific about AI's limited role and human review."

    prompt_text: |
      Create a task record with: date, files supplied, connected sources used, web research on/off, decisions made, unresolved questions, outputs created, and human reviewer. Use "not used" or "not yet assigned" where appropriate.
    checkpoint: "The record distinguishes inputs, settings, decisions, and review responsibility."

## Draft a Transparent Patron Handoff

ALA's June 2026 guidance calls for clear disclosure, meaningful human review, and a path to human assistance. A useful handoff makes the work visible without overstating what AI or the librarian has completed.

## Discussion

- What would make a disclosure informative rather than performative?
- Who is accountable if an AI-assisted search brief is wrong?
- How long should the task record be retained?

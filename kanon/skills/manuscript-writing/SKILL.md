# Manuscript Writing

## Overview

Manuscript writing is the craft of communicating research with precision,
clarity, and reproducibility. This guided skill covers the manuscript lifecycle
— planning and structuring with IMRAD, applying a citation style, designing
figures and tables, and meeting reporting standards — and applies across
disciplines (computational, physical, social, and biomedical). It is one member
of the Archimedes Delight collection; for reference formatting use
`citation-management`, and for figure preparation use `figure-preparation`.

## Key Concepts

### Writing principles

Three pillars govern manuscript text:

- **Clarity** — precise, unambiguous language; define terms at first use;
  logical flow; active voice where it helps.
- **Conciseness** — the fewest words that carry the meaning; cut filler
  ("in order to" → "to"); strong verbs over noun-verb phrases.
- **Accuracy** — exact values at appropriate precision; consistent terminology;
  observations distinguished from interpretations; text that matches tables and
  figures.

### IMRAD structure

IMRAD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) is the standard shape for
original research articles.

| Section | Question | Primary tense |
|---|---|---|
| Title | What is this about? | — |
| Abstract | Complete summary | mixed |
| Introduction | Why did you study this? | present/past |
| Methods | How did you do it? | past |
| Results | What did you find? | past |
| Discussion | What does it mean? | past/present |
| Conclusion | Take-home message | present |

The Introduction funnels from broad context to the specific gap and objectives.
Methods must allow replication. Results state findings without interpretation.
Discussion interprets, compares to prior work, and states limitations.

### Citation systems

| Style | Form | Typical disciplines |
|---|---|---|
| AMA | superscript numbers | medicine, health |
| Vancouver | bracketed numbers [1] | biomedical |
| APA | author-date (Smith, 2023) | psychology, social science |
| Chicago | notes or author-date | humanities |
| IEEE | bracketed numbers [1] | engineering, CS |

The target venue's author guidelines decide the style. For setting up a
reference workflow and formatting, hand off to `citation-management`.

### Reporting guidelines

Match the guideline to the study type early — during design, not after writing:
CONSORT (trials), STROBE (observational), PRISMA (systematic reviews), ARRIVE
(animal studies), STARD (diagnostic accuracy), TRIPOD (prediction models),
SPIRIT (protocols), CARE (case reports). Use the checklist while drafting.

### Revision Protocol

Peer-review and editorial feedback is worked systematically, not cherry-picked.
Handle a round of feedback in four moves:

1. **Categorize** every feedback item by severity — **Critical** (must fix or the
   paper is unsound), **Major** (substantive weakness), **Minor** (small
   correction), or **Suggestion** (optional improvement).
2. **Track** every item in a revision log so nothing is silently dropped:

   | # | Source | Severity | Feedback | Action | Status |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | 1 | Reviewer 2 | Critical | Confound not controlled | Added covariate to model | Resolved |
   | 2 | Editor | Major | Limitations understated | Expanded limitations paragraph | Resolved |
   | 3 | Reviewer 1 | Minor | Figure 2 axis unlabeled | Relabeled axis | Resolved |
   | 4 | Reviewer 3 | Suggestion | Add sensitivity analysis | Out of scope this round | Acknowledged |

3. **Resolve in order** — address all Critical and Major items first, then Minor
   items and any viable Suggestions.
4. **Document what you don't change** — record items you decline to address as
   acknowledged limitations, with the reason, rather than leaving them unanswered
   in the response-to-reviewers.

## Decision Framework

```
What are you writing?
├── Original research
│   ├── Trial            → IMRAD + CONSORT
│   ├── Observational    → IMRAD + STROBE
│   ├── Diagnostic       → IMRAD + STARD
│   ├── Prediction model → IMRAD + TRIPOD
│   └── ML / CS          → Intro–Method–Experiments–Conclusion
├── Review
│   ├── Systematic       → PRISMA
│   ├── Meta-analysis    → PRISMA + forest plots
│   └── Narrative        → thematic structure
├── Case report          → CARE
└── Protocol             → SPIRIT
```

| Venue | Structure | Citation | Adaptation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Broad-science (Nature/Science) | modified IMRAD, methods in supplement | numbered superscript | accessible, story-driven, broad significance |
| Medical | strict IMRAD | Vancouver/AMA | structured abstracts, CONSORT/STROBE |
| Field journals | standard IMRAD | field default | full technical detail |
| ML conferences | Intro–Method–Experiments–Conclusion | numbered or author-year | numbered contributions, ablations |

## Best Practices

1. **Write the abstract last** — synthesize the key message in 100–250 words with quantitative results.
2. **Plan figures before prose** — design the display items as the data story; write Methods → Results → Discussion → Introduction.
3. **One idea per paragraph** — topic sentence, evidence, transition; 3–7 sentences.
4. **Report statistics completely** — point estimate, variability (SD/SEM/CI), n, test statistic, exact p-value, effect size.
5. **Follow the reporting guideline from the start** — use its checklist while drafting, not after.
6. **Match style to venue** — read 3–5 recent papers from the target journal and mirror their conventions.
7. **Verify citation–reference correspondence** — every in-text citation has a reference entry and vice versa.
8. **Work reviewer feedback systematically** — categorize every item by severity, track it in a revision log, resolve Critical/Major first, and document unaddressed items as acknowledged limitations (see the Revision Protocol).

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Overstating conclusions beyond the evidence** (causation from observational data).
   - *How to avoid*: hedge appropriately ("is associated with"); match claim strength to design.
2. **Inconsistent terminology** (switching words for one concept).
   - *How to avoid*: one term per concept; keep a terminology list.
3. **Mixing verb tenses** inappropriately across sections.
   - *How to avoid*: apply the section tense rules; review for tense in revision.
4. **Insufficient methods detail** for reproducibility (missing n, software versions, test justifications).
   - *How to avoid*: use the reporting-guideline checklist to catch omissions.
5. **Figures that don't stand alone** (captions missing units, n, definitions).
   - *How to avoid*: make each display item self-explanatory; see `figure-preparation`.

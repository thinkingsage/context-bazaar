      Convert research-request.txt into a research brief with these headings:
      Decision or use; Population or context; Core concept; Outcomes; Date range; Geography; Evidence types; Access needs; Known ambiguities; Missing information.

      Use only the file. Mark missing information as "ask the researcher" rather than guessing.

    prompt_text: |
      Draft five concise follow-up questions for the faculty member. Prioritize questions whose answers would materially change the search strategy. For each, add a short note explaining what search decision it affects.
    checkpoint: "The questions address outcome definitions, intended use, disciplinary scope, and acceptable evidence."

    prompt_text: |
      Suppose I offer to upload the faculty member's full email thread, unpublished grant draft, and a spreadsheet containing collaborator names. Explain which items should not be uploaded under WORKSPACE-BRIEF.md and propose a de-identified alternative that preserves the information needed for search planning.
    checkpoint: "The response recommends data minimization instead of accepting the files."

## Turn a Request into a Research Brief

Research requests often arrive as topics, while good searches are built around decisions, concepts, outcomes, constraints, and acceptable evidence. This exercise uses AI for question decomposition while keeping the librarian responsible for scope and consent.

## Discussion

- Which missing detail would change the search most?
- How can a structured brief improve handoffs among research-support staff?
- What should never be inferred from a patron's request?

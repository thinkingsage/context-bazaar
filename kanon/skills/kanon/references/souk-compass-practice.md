# Optional Practice: Semantic Search with Souk Compass

## Purpose

Use this optional practice after completing Tutorial Lesson 10, **Editing Your Artifact**, and Lesson 16, **Evaluating Artifacts**. It introduces Souk Compass, an MCP server that indexes Kanon knowledge artifacts and searches them by meaning. The practice focuses on validating retrieval quality in an approved, nonproduction environment.

Souk Compass can return relevant artifacts, snippets, and similarity scores. It does not establish that a result is authoritative, current, complete, or suitable for a particular Libraries workflow. Read the canonical source and apply human judgment before using a result.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this practice, learners will be able to:

1. **Describe** how Souk Compass complements the catalog bridge by finding artifacts through natural-language search.
2. **Use** health, status, index, search, and reindex tools in a configured practice environment.
3. **Evaluate** search results against representative queries, expected artifacts, and unacceptable results.
4. **Identify** information that must not be indexed without explicit approval.

## Time and Prerequisites

- **Estimated time:** 60–90 minutes.
- **Required tutorial work:** Lessons 10 and 16.
- **Technical setup:** A technical steward has configured Souk Compass and the MCP client, and has provided an approved practice environment.
- **Practice data:** Public, invented, or explicitly approved content only.
- **Before indexing:** Confirm the collection, repository, folder, or document is approved for semantic search and that the intended users may access the resulting index.

### What This Practice Does Not Cover

This module does not ask learners to install Docker, configure Solr, add cloud credentials, modify a shared MCP configuration, or enable automatic reindexing hooks. Those tasks affect shared infrastructure or user environments and should be completed only by the responsible technical team. The [Souk Compass Solr setup guide](../../../mcp-servers/souk-compass/solr/README.md) documents that administrator workflow.

## Before You Search

### Protect Information

Semantic search stores content and vectors in a search environment. Do not index:

- restricted, confidential, personal, donor, personnel, or patron information;
- credentials, tokens, private URLs, or internal security details;
- licensed content whose use in a search index has not been approved;
- unpublished records, collection descriptions, or policy drafts without the content owner's approval; or
- a source folder merely because it is convenient to search.

If the appropriate owner has not approved indexing, stop and ask for direction. A local test environment does not by itself make restricted content appropriate for indexing.

### Write a Retrieval Question

Before using a search tool, write down:

| Prompt | Your Notes |
|--------|------------|
| User need | What is the person trying to find or decide? |
| Search query | How would the person express that need in ordinary language? |
| Expected artifact | Which artifact should appear, if any? |
| Useful evidence | Which title, description, topic, or excerpt would show relevance? |
| Unacceptable result | What would make a result misleading, irrelevant, or unsafe? |
| Human next step | Who verifies the source before it is used? |

Use a narrow question for the first test. For example: “How do I create and validate a knowledge artifact?” This question should reasonably surface the Kanon artifact or its authoring materials.

## Part 1: Confirm the Practice Environment

**Goal:** Verify that the configured service is available before indexing or searching.

Ask the MCP client to run the following tools with empty input:

```text
compass_health({})
compass_status({})
```

`compass_health` checks connectivity and whether the configured collections exist. `compass_status` reports the configured collections and document counts.

Record the result in your learning notes:

| Check | Result | What It Means |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Health | | The service and collections are available, unavailable, or need attention. |
| Status | | The index contains the expected number of practice documents or artifacts. |
| Environment owner | | The person or team responsible for configuration and access. |

If the service is unavailable, do not troubleshoot infrastructure by changing settings or starting containers unless that work is within your assigned role. Record the result and contact the environment owner.

### Checkpoint

- [ ] I confirmed that I am using an approved practice environment.
- [ ] I ran health and status checks or documented why I could not.
- [ ] I recorded the environment owner and did not change shared configuration.

---

## Part 2: Index a Known Practice Artifact

**Goal:** Add one approved artifact to the search index and verify that the index reflects the change.

Use a small artifact already approved for this practice. In this repository, the `kanon` artifact is a suitable example because it contains training guidance. Do not substitute a Libraries artifact unless its owner has approved indexing.

Ask the MCP client to index the artifact:

```text
compass_index_artifacts({ name: "kanon", chunked: true })
```

The `chunked` option divides longer content into smaller search units. This can improve retrieval of a specific section, but it also means a result may describe only part of an artifact. Read the canonical source before acting on a result.

Run `compass_status({})` again. Note whether the artifact collection count changed as expected. If the artifact was already indexed, the count may not change; record that observation rather than forcing a duplicate index.

### Checkpoint

- [ ] I indexed one approved practice artifact or documented why it was already indexed.
- [ ] I checked status after indexing.
- [ ] I can explain why a search result may represent only a chunk of a longer source.

---

## Part 3: Search by Meaning and Verify the Source

**Goal:** Run representative searches, compare results with expectations, and return to the canonical source.

Start with a clear, plain-language request:

```text
compass_search({
  query: "How do I create and validate a knowledge artifact?",
  topK: 5,
  scope: "artifacts",
  mode: "hybrid",
  includeContent: false
})
```

Hybrid mode combines keyword and vector search. The default results include artifact metadata and a snippet when available. Keep `includeContent` false during initial exploration so you retrieve only the minimum information needed to decide which source to open.

For each promising result, record:

- the artifact name and displayed title;
- why the result appears relevant;
- whether the snippet supports the relevance claim;
- whether the result is stale, incomplete, or outside the question; and
- the canonical file or catalog entry you will review next.

If the catalog bridge is also configured, use the returned artifact name with `artifact_content` to read the canonical content. Search results help you discover a source; they do not replace the source.

### Add Two More Queries

Use queries that differ in wording and specificity. For example:

```text
compass_search({
  query: "instructions for authoring a reusable skill",
  topK: 5,
  type: "power",
  scope: "artifacts",
  mode: "hybrid"
})

compass_search({
  query: "check an artifact for unsafe instructions before building it",
  topK: 5,
  scope: "artifacts",
  mode: "hybrid"
})
```

The expected result need not rank first in every query. The goal is to examine whether the result set gives a staff member a reasonable path to the correct, reviewed source.

### Retrieval Review Table

| Query | Expected Artifact or Topic | Top Results | Useful? | Review Notes |
|-------|----------------------------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| | | | Yes / No / Partly | |
| | | | Yes / No / Partly | |
| | | | Yes / No / Partly | |

### Checkpoint

- [ ] I tested at least three queries.
- [ ] I compared each result set with an expected artifact or topic.
- [ ] I opened at least one canonical source rather than relying on a snippet.
- [ ] I noted at least one limitation, unexpected result, or follow-up question.

---

## Part 4: Test Index Freshness

**Goal:** Understand how the index is updated after an approved source changes.

Do not edit a shared artifact solely to test the index. Instead, use a known change in the practice environment or ask the environment owner to identify an approved test change.

Ask the MCP client to run incremental reindexing:

```text
compass_reindex({})
```

Souk Compass compares content hashes to detect added, updated, and removed artifacts. Review the result for three categories:

| Result Category | What to Check |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Added | Is the new artifact expected and approved for the index? |
| Updated | Does the index reflect a reviewed source change? |
| Removed | Was the removal expected, and are retrieval links or documentation affected? |

Use `force: true` only when the responsible technical team has directed a full reindex. A full reindex can take more time and use more resources than an incremental update.

### Checkpoint

- [ ] I ran or observed an incremental reindex.
- [ ] I explained the difference between incremental and forced reindexing.
- [ ] I recorded how a source change should be reviewed before it becomes searchable.

---

## Part 5: Evaluate Retrieval Quality

**Goal:** Turn observations into a small, repeatable retrieval evaluation.

Build a six-query test set from approved practice content. Include:

- two common questions that should find a known artifact;
- two paraphrases that use different vocabulary;
- one boundary question that should not return a confident but irrelevant answer; and
- one question for which the correct response is “no suitable indexed source found.”

For each query, judge the first five results using these criteria:

| Criterion | Pass | Needs Review |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| Relevance | At least one result is a reasonable starting point for the stated need. | The results do not relate to the need or omit an expected source. |
| Source traceability | A learner can open the canonical artifact or catalog entry. | A snippet is present but the source cannot be identified. |
| Scope | The result does not imply authority beyond the source's stated purpose. | The result encourages use outside its stated scope. |
| Safety | No restricted or unapproved practice content appears. | Sensitive, private, or unapproved content is present or suggested. |
| Uncertainty | Weak or absent matches are treated as leads for review. | A weak result is presented as a confident answer. |

Record one action for every “Needs Review” result. Actions may include revising artifact descriptions, improving keywords, correcting the source, adjusting the test query, removing unapproved material, or asking the environment owner to inspect indexing configuration.

### Optional: Compare Search Modes

For one query, repeat the search with `mode: "keyword"` and `mode: "vector"`. Compare the result sets with `mode: "hybrid"`.

Do not assume that one mode is universally best. Keep the mode that gives the most understandable, traceable results for the approved test set.

### Checkpoint

- [ ] I completed a six-query retrieval evaluation.
- [ ] I distinguished a helpful lead from an authoritative answer.
- [ ] I recorded an action for each result that needs review.
- [ ] I know who should review index scope, source quality, and infrastructure settings.

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] I completed Tutorial Lessons 10 and 16 before this practice.
- [ ] I used only approved practice content.
- [ ] I confirmed service health and status.
- [ ] I indexed or verified one known practice artifact.
- [ ] I tested at least three queries and inspected canonical sources.
- [ ] I ran or observed incremental reindexing.
- [ ] I evaluated six representative queries.
- [ ] I documented limitations, follow-up actions, and responsible reviewers.

## Troubleshooting and Escalation

| Situation | Safe Next Step |
|-----------|----------------|
| Health check fails | Record the error and contact the environment owner. Do not change Solr, Docker, or MCP settings without authorization. |
| Search returns no results | Confirm that the approved artifact is indexed, simplify the query, and check the canonical catalog before changing search settings. |
| Search returns an irrelevant result | Record the query and result; review the source description, keywords, and test set with the content owner. |
| A result appears restricted or private | Stop using that index for the exercise and notify the environment owner and content owner. |
| A tool result conflicts with a source document | Treat the canonical source as the item to review and flag the discrepancy. |
| You need shared or production deployment | Escalate to the responsible technical, information-governance, and content owners. |

## Next Steps

- Read the [Souk Compass Solr setup guide](../../../mcp-servers/souk-compass/solr/README.md) if infrastructure setup is within your assigned role.
- Review the [Souk Compass architecture decision record](../../../docs/adr/0031-souk-compass-standalone-mcp-server-for-semantic-search.md) for design rationale and trade-offs.
- Add the approved retrieval test set to your team’s evaluation records before expanding the index or changing a production workflow.

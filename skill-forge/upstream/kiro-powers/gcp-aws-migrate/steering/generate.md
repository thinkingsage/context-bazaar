# Phase 5: Generate Migration Artifacts (Orchestrator)

**Execute ALL steps in order. Do not skip or optimize.**

## Overview

The Generate phase has **2 mandatory stages** that run sequentially:

1. **Stage 1: Migration Planning** — Produces execution plans (JSON) from estimation + design artifacts
2. **Stage 2: Artifact Generation** — Produces deployable code (Terraform, scripts, adapters, docs) from plans + designs

Both stages must complete for the phase to succeed.

## Prerequisites

Read `$MIGRATION_DIR/preferences.json`. If missing: **STOP**. Output: "Phase 2 (Clarify) not completed. Run Phase 2 first."

Check which estimation artifacts exist in `$MIGRATION_DIR/`:

- `estimation-infra.json` (infrastructure estimation)
- `estimation-ai.json` (AI workload estimation)
- `estimation-billing.json` (billing-only estimation)

If **none** of these estimation artifacts exist: **STOP**. Output: "No estimation artifacts found. Run Phase 4 (Estimate) first."

## Stage 1: Migration Planning

Route based on which estimation artifacts exist. Multiple paths can run independently.

### Infrastructure Migration Plan

IF `estimation-infra.json` exists:

> Load `generate-infra.md`

Produces: `generation-infra.json`

### AI Migration Plan

IF `estimation-ai.json` exists:

> Load `generate-ai.md`

Produces: `generation-ai.json`

### Billing-Only Migration Plan

IF `estimation-billing.json` exists:

> Load `generate-billing.md`

Produces: `generation-billing.json`

## Stage 2: Artifact Generation

**MUST proceed only after Stage 1 completes.** Route based on generation plans + design artifacts.

### Infrastructure Artifacts

IF `generation-infra.json` AND `aws-design.json` exist:

> Load `generate-artifacts-infra.md`

Produces: `terraform/` directory

After generate-artifacts-infra.md completes (terraform files generated),
load `generate-artifacts-scripts.md` to generate migration scripts.

Produces: `scripts/` directory

### AI Artifacts

IF `generation-ai.json` AND `aws-design-ai.json` exist:

> Load `generate-artifacts-ai.md`

Produces: `ai-migration/` directory

### Billing Skeleton Artifacts

IF `generation-billing.json` AND `aws-design-billing.json` exist:

> Load `generate-artifacts-billing.md`

Produces: `terraform/skeleton.tf` (with TODO markers)

### Documentation (ALWAYS runs last)

AFTER all above artifact generation sub-files complete:

> Load `generate-artifacts-docs.md`

Produces: `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`, `README.md`

## Phase Completion

Verify both stages are complete:

1. **Stage 1**: At least one `generation-*.json` file exists
2. **Stage 2**: At least one artifact directory or file was produced, plus documentation

Use the Phase Status Update Protocol (Write tool) to write `.phase-status.json` with `phases.generate` set to `"completed"` — **in the same turn** as the summary below.

## Summary

Present final summary to user:

1. **Plans generated** — List all `generation-*.json` files produced
2. **Artifacts generated** — List all directories and files created (terraform/, scripts/, ai-migration/, MIGRATION_GUIDE.md, README.md)
3. **Key timelines** — Highlight migration timeline from the generation plans
4. **Key risks** — Highlight top risks from the generation plans
5. **TODO markers** — Note any TODO markers in generated artifacts that require manual attention
6. **Next steps** — Recommend reviewing generated artifacts, customizing TODO sections, and beginning migration execution

Output to user: "Migration artifact generation complete. All phases of the GCP-to-AWS migration analysis are complete."

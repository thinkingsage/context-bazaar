# Kiro Arm SoC Migration Power

A Kiro power that guides developers through migrating code from one Arm-based System-on-Chip (SoC) to another, ensuring architecture-aware analysis and safe migration practices.

## Overview

This power helps you migrate embedded, automotive, or general-purpose applications between different Arm SoCs while preserving functional behavior, safety properties, and code quality.

**Common migration scenarios:**
- AWS Graviton → Raspberry Pi
- AWS Graviton2 → AWS Graviton3
- NXP i.MX8 → NVIDIA Jetson Orin
- Qualcomm Snapdragon → STM32MP1

The power provides architecture-aware analysis, identifies platform-specific code, and guides safe refactoring while maintaining compatibility and performance.

## Available Steering Files

This power has the following steering files for detailed workflow guidance:

- **discovery** — Discovery and Analysis: scan codebases for platform-specific code, compare architectures, identify HAL requirements
- **planning** — Migration Planning: generate migration plans, risk assessments, and performance impact analysis
- **implementation** — Implementation Guidance: refactor platform-specific code, build HAL abstractions, update build systems
- **validation** — Validation and Testing: cross-compilation verification, performance benchmarking, functional test suites
- **constraints** — Migration constraints and safety rules that apply to all Arm SoC migrations

All conceptual knowledge is in this POWER.md file. The steering files provide detailed workflow examples with complete code samples.

## Onboarding

### Prerequisites

**Required Information:**
Before beginning any migration work, you must specify:
1. **Source Arm SoC** — Current platform (e.g., BCM2711, AWS Graviton2, NXP i.MX8)
2. **Target Arm SoC** — Destination platform (e.g., BCM2712, STM32MP1)

**System Requirements:**
- Cross-compilation toolchains for both source and target architectures
- Access to source code with build system (CMake, Make, or similar)
- Development environment with Arm analysis tools

### Installation

The Arm MCP Server runs as a Docker container, providing a consistent and isolated environment.

#### Docker Installation

**Step 1: Install Docker**

Ensure Docker is installed and running:
```bash
# Verify Docker installation
docker --version

# Test Docker is running
docker ps
```

If Docker is not installed:
- macOS: Download Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install docker.io` or use your package manager
- Windows: Download Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

**Step 2: Configure Kiro MCP Settings**

The Arm MCP Server is configured in Kiro's MCP configuration file. This power includes a pre-configured `mcp.json` that uses Docker.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arm-mcp-server": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "--pull=always", "armlimited/arm-mcp:latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "ARM_MCP_CACHE_DIR": "~/.cache/arm-mcp",
        "ARM_MCP_TIMEOUT": "30"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": ["knowledge_base_search", "sysreport_instructions"],
      "disabledTools": ["migrate_ease_scan"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Options Explained:**
- `command`: Uses Docker to run the containerized MCP server
- `args`: 
  - `run`: Start a new container
  - `--rm`: Automatically remove container when it exits
  - `-i`: Keep STDIN open for interactive communication
  - `--pull=always`: Always pull the latest image before running
  - `armlimited/arm-mcp:latest`: Official Arm MCP Docker image
- `env.FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL`: Reduces logging verbosity (set to "DEBUG" for troubleshooting)
- `env.ARM_MCP_CACHE_DIR`: Directory for caching Arm documentation and embeddings
- `env.ARM_MCP_TIMEOUT`: Server timeout in seconds
- `autoApprove`: Tools that don't require user confirmation (safe read-only operations)
- `disabledTools`: Tools disabled for safety (migrate_ease_scan requires careful manual review)

**Step 3: First Run**

The Docker image will be automatically pulled when you first use this power. The `--pull=always` flag ensures you always have the latest version.

**First-time usage will:**
1. Pull the `armlimited/arm-mcp:latest` Docker image from Docker Hub
2. Start the container with MCP server
3. Initialize Arm knowledge base and embeddings
4. Connect to Kiro automatically

**Note:** The first launch may take 1-2 minutes as Docker downloads the image (~500MB). Subsequent launches are much faster as the image is cached locally.

**Optional: Pre-pull the Docker Image**

To avoid waiting during first use, you can pre-pull the image:
```bash
docker pull armlimited/arm-mcp:latest
```

#### Build Custom Docker Image (Advanced)

If you need to customize the Docker image:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mcp/arm/arm-mcp
cd arm-mcp

# Build for your platform
docker build -f mcp-local/Dockerfile -t arm-mcp:custom mcp-local

# Update mcp.json to use your custom image
# Change "armlimited/arm-mcp:latest" to "arm-mcp:custom"
```

#### Verifying Installation

After installation, verify the MCP server is working:

**Step 1: Check Docker Image**
```bash
docker images | grep arm-mcp
```

**Step 2: Test Docker Container**
```bash
docker run --rm armlimited/arm-mcp:latest --version
```

**Step 3: Check MCP Server Status in Kiro**

1. Open Kiro → View → MCP Servers (or use Command Palette: "MCP: Show Servers")
2. Look for "arm-mcp-server" in the list
3. Status should show green/connected
4. If red/disconnected, click "Reconnect" or "Restart"

**Step 4: Test MCP Server Tools**

Ask Kiro to test the server:
```
"Search the Arm knowledge base for BCM2711 architecture information"
```

**Step 5: Verify Cross-Compilation Tools (Optional)**
```bash
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc --version
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc --version
cmake --version
make --version
```

**If cross-compilation tools are missing:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf

# macOS
brew install aarch64-elf-gcc
brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

### Initial Setup

**Step 1: Specify Migration Context**

Tell Kiro your source and target SoCs:
```
"I need to migrate from BCM2711 (Raspberry Pi 4) to BCM2712 (Raspberry Pi 5)"
```

**Step 2: Project Structure**

Ensure your project follows recommended structure:
```
project/
├── src/           # Application code
├── include/       # Headers
├── platform/      # Platform-specific code
├── hal/           # Hardware abstraction layer
└── CMakeLists.txt # Build configuration
```

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Discovery and Analysis

Identify platform-specific code and architecture differences between source and target SoCs. This workflow scans your codebase for hard-coded addresses, direct register access, and platform-dependent logic, then compares architecture capabilities and identifies HAL requirements.

For detailed steps and complete examples, load the steering file:
```
readSteering: powerName="arm-soc-migration", steeringFile="discovery.md"
```

### Workflow 2: Migration Planning

Create a detailed migration strategy with phased timelines, risk assessments, and performance impact analysis. Covers risk categorization (high/medium/low), mitigation strategies, and expected performance deltas between source and target architectures.

For detailed steps and complete examples, load the steering file:
```
readSteering: powerName="arm-soc-migration", steeringFile="planning.md"
```

### Workflow 3: Implementation Guidance

Execute the migration with proper platform abstraction. Covers refactoring platform-specific code into HAL layers, updating build systems for dual-platform support, and implementing peripheral abstractions (GPIO, SPI, I2C) for both source and target SoCs.

For detailed steps and complete examples, load the steering file:
```
readSteering: powerName="arm-soc-migration", steeringFile="implementation.md"
```

### Workflow 4: Validation and Testing

Verify migration correctness and performance. Covers cross-compilation verification scripts, performance benchmarking frameworks, and functional test suites that validate identical behavior across both platforms.

For detailed steps and complete examples, load the steering file:
```
readSteering: powerName="arm-soc-migration", steeringFile="validation.md"
```

## MCP Server Tools

The Arm MCP Server provides these analysis capabilities:

### Architecture Analysis
- **knowledge_base_search**: Find Arm documentation and compatibility information
- **check_image**: Verify Docker image architecture support
- **skopeo**: Inspect container image architectures
- **mca**: Assembly code performance analysis

### Migration Analysis
- **sysreport_instructions**: Get system architecture information

**Note:** The `migrate_ease_scan` tool is disabled for this power to ensure manual, careful migration practices.

## Migration Constraints

This power enforces strict safety constraints defined in `constraints.md`:

### Critical Rules
- **Preserve Behavior**: No silent API or timing changes
- **Platform Abstraction**: SoC-specific code must be isolated in HAL layers
- **Safety Properties**: Maintain input validation and error handling
- **Documentation**: All changes must be justified and recorded

### Architecture Considerations
- Arm version differences (Armv7, Armv8, Armv9)
- Core type variations (Cortex-A72 vs Cortex-A76)
- SIMD capabilities (NEON, SVE, SVE2)
- Memory model and cache differences

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Connection Issues

**Problem:** Arm MCP Server won't start or connect

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Docker is running: `docker ps`
2. Check Docker permissions (Linux): `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
3. Test container directly: `docker run --rm -i armlimited/arm-mcp:latest`
4. Check Kiro MCP Server panel status
5. Force pull latest image: `docker pull armlimited/arm-mcp:latest`
6. Check logs in Kiro: Open MCP Servers panel → click "arm-mcp-server" → view logs
7. Enable debug logging: Change `"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"` to `"DEBUG"` in `mcp.json`
8. Restart Kiro

### Cross-Compilation Errors

**Error:** "aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc: command not found"
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu

# macOS
brew install aarch64-elf-gcc
```

### Platform Detection Issues

**Error:** "Unable to determine source SoC characteristics"
1. Explicitly specify source and target SoCs
2. Provide platform documentation or datasheets
3. Use architecture analysis tools to identify current platform

### HAL Layer Conflicts

**Error:** "Conflicting HAL implementations detected"
1. Review platform abstraction layer design
2. Ensure single HAL interface with multiple implementations
3. Use conditional compilation for platform-specific code

## Best Practices

- **Start with Discovery**: Always analyze existing code before making changes
- **Incremental Migration**: Migrate one subsystem at a time
- **Maintain Compatibility**: Keep source platform working during migration
- **Document Decisions**: Record all platform-specific choices and rationales
- **Test Thoroughly**: Validate both functional and performance requirements
- **Use HAL Layers**: Abstract all hardware-specific operations
- **Version Control**: Use feature branches for migration work

## Working Without MCP Server (Fallback Mode)

If you're unable to get the Arm MCP Server working, you can still use this power with reduced functionality:

1. **Manual SoC Specification:** Provide architecture details directly
2. **Manual Code Review:** Ask for platform-specific dependency analysis
3. **Architecture Documentation:** Provide links to SoC datasheets for manual analysis

**Available without MCP:**
- Migration Planning, Implementation Guidance, Best Practices

**Requires MCP:**
- Automated Analysis, Performance Profiling, Architecture Comparison

## Configuration

### Automatic Configuration (Recommended)

No additional configuration required — works after MCP server is installed in Kiro.

### Manual Configuration (Advanced Users)

**Environment Variables:**
- `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL`: Set to "ERROR" to reduce MCP server logging (optional)
- `ARM_MCP_CACHE_DIR`: Custom cache directory (default: ~/.cache/arm-mcp)
- `ARM_MCP_TIMEOUT`: Server timeout in seconds (default: 30)

**MCP Server Customization:**
Advanced users can modify `mcp.json` to enable additional tools, adjust auto-approval settings, or modify environment variables.

## Constraints

# Migration Constraints

These constraints apply to all Arm SoC-to-SoC migrations regardless of source or target platform.

## Initial Requirements

- Before any migration work begins, the developer MUST specify:
  - The source Arm SoC (current platform)
  - The target Arm SoC (destination platform)
- If this information is not provided, prompt the developer to supply it before proceeding.

## Functional Behavior

- The migration must not change externally visible functional behavior unless
  explicitly requested. Any change to public APIs, communication protocols, or
  configuration interfaces must be documented and justified.

## Safety Properties

- Safety properties must not be degraded:
  - Do not remove or weaken input validation and range checks.
  - Do not remove diagnostic logging in safety-relevant paths without a documented reason.
  - Do not introduce non-deterministic behavior in previously deterministic control paths.

## Platform Abstraction

- No hard-coding of target SoC specifics into generic modules:
  - Board-specific constants (GPIO pins, bus IDs, device paths, memory maps) must live in platform/HAL layers.
  - Code that is logically platform-independent must remain platform-independent.
  - Create or extend platform abstraction layers for SoC-specific functionality.

## Timing and Performance

- Do not silently relax timing constraints (e.g., control-loop cycle times, interrupt latencies).
- Any known change in timing behavior must be explicitly documented.
- Profile and compare performance characteristics between source and target SoCs.

## Build and Deployment

- Do not remove the ability to build and run on the source platform unless explicitly requested.
- If source platform support is deprecated, document this clearly.
- Maintain build system compatibility for both platforms during transition.

## Safety and Compliance

- Do not introduce undefined behavior, data races, or reliance on unspecified
  compiler or CPU behavior.
- Where applicable standards (MISRA, ISO 26262, AUTOSAR, etc.) are in play, new code must
  not obviously violate them; where compliance is uncertain, state the risk.
- Consider differences in memory models, cache behavior, and atomics between SoCs.

## Hardware I/O

- Direct hardware access must be isolated in the target platform's HAL layer.
- Timing-critical I/O manipulations must be carefully documented.
- Peripheral differences (SPI, I2C, UART, GPIO) must be abstracted appropriately.

## Architecture Considerations

- Identify and document differences in:
  - Arm architecture version (Armv7, Armv8, Armv9)
  - Core type (Cortex-A, Cortex-M, Cortex-R, Neoverse)
  - SIMD capabilities (NEON, SVE, SVE2)
  - Memory hierarchy and cache sizes
  - Endianness and alignment requirements

## Documentation

- Every non-trivial platform-specific change must be reflected in design or migration docs.
- Migration rationales must be understandable by another engineer reviewing the changes.
- Document any feature gaps or limitations of the target SoC compared to the source.

## Discovery

# Workflow 1: Discovery and Analysis

**Goal:** Identify platform-specific code and architecture differences between source and target Arm SoCs.

## Complete Example: BCM2711 → BCM2712 Migration

### Step 1: Scan Codebase for Platform Dependencies

```
"Scan my codebase for BCM2711-specific code that needs migration to BCM2712. Focus on GPIO, SPI, and memory-mapped I/O."
```

**Example Analysis Results:**
```
Platform-Specific Code Found:

📁 src/gpio_driver.c:
  - Line 15: #define GPIO_BASE 0x7E200000  // BCM2711 specific
  - Line 23: Direct register access via *(gpio_base + offset)
  - Line 45: BCM2711 pull-up/down register sequence

📁 include/config.h:
  - Line 8: #define SPI0_BASE 0x7E204000   // BCM2711 specific
  - Line 12: GPIO pin assignments (BCM numbering)

📁 platform/bcm2711/spi.c:
  - Line 30: Clock divider calculations for BCM2711
  - Line 67: Interrupt handling for BCM2711 SPI controller

Recommendations:
✅ Move GPIO_BASE to platform-specific header
✅ Abstract register access through HAL functions
✅ Create BCM2712 platform directory
```

### Step 2: Analyze Architecture Differences

```
"Compare BCM2711 and BCM2712 architecture capabilities, focusing on CPU cores, SIMD, and peripheral differences"
```

**Example Architecture Comparison:**
```
Architecture Analysis: BCM2711 vs BCM2712

CPU Cores:
  BCM2711: 4x Cortex-A72 @ 1.5GHz (ARMv8-A)
  BCM2712: 4x Cortex-A76 @ 2.4GHz (ARMv8.2-A)
  Impact: ~40% performance improvement, new instructions available

SIMD Capabilities:
  BCM2711: NEON (128-bit vectors)
  BCM2712: NEON + additional ARMv8.2 SIMD instructions
  Impact: Potential for better vectorization

Memory:
  BCM2711: LPDDR4-3200, 35GB/s bandwidth
  BCM2712: LPDDR4X-4267, 67GB/s bandwidth
  Impact: Significantly improved memory performance

Peripherals:
  BCM2711: Legacy GPIO controller
  BCM2712: New RP1 I/O controller (PCIe-connected)
  Impact: Major change - GPIO/SPI/I2C access methods different
```

### Step 3: Identify HAL Requirements

```
"What HAL changes are needed for BCM2712 migration? Focus on the new RP1 I/O controller."
```

**Example HAL Analysis:**
```
HAL Layer Requirements:

Current HAL Status:
❌ No abstraction for GPIO register access
❌ SPI driver directly accesses BCM2711 registers
✅ UART already abstracted through HAL

Required Changes:

1. GPIO HAL Enhancement:
   - Abstract RP1 I/O controller access
   - Maintain BCM2711 compatibility
   - Add pin multiplexing support

2. SPI HAL Creation:
   - Create common SPI interface
   - BCM2711 implementation (existing)
   - BCM2712/RP1 implementation (new)

3. Build System Updates:
   - Platform selection mechanism
   - Conditional compilation support
   - Cross-compilation targets
```

## Implementation

# Workflow 3: Implementation Guidance

**Goal:** Execute migration with proper platform abstraction, HAL design, and build system updates.

## Complete Example: GPIO and SPI HAL Implementation

### Step 1: Refactor Platform-Specific Code

```
"Help me refactor my GPIO access code for BCM2712 compatibility. Here's my current BCM2711-specific GPIO driver that needs abstraction."
```

**Example Code Refactoring:**

**Before (BCM2711-specific):**
```c
// gpio_driver.c - BCM2711 specific
#define GPIO_BASE 0x7E200000
#define GPFSEL0   (GPIO_BASE + 0x00)
#define GPSET0    (GPIO_BASE + 0x1C)
#define GPCLR0    (GPIO_BASE + 0x28)

void gpio_set_output(int pin) {
    volatile uint32_t *gpfsel = (uint32_t*)GPFSEL0;
    int reg = pin / 10;
    int shift = (pin % 10) * 3;
    gpfsel[reg] &= ~(7 << shift);
    gpfsel[reg] |= (1 << shift);
}
```

**After (HAL abstracted):**
```c
// hal/gpio.h - Platform abstraction
typedef struct {
    int (*init)(void);
    int (*set_mode)(uint8_t pin, gpio_mode_t mode);
    int (*write)(uint8_t pin, uint8_t value);
    int (*read)(uint8_t pin);
    void (*cleanup)(void);
} gpio_hal_t;

// platform/bcm2711/gpio_bcm2711.c
static int bcm2711_gpio_set_mode(uint8_t pin, gpio_mode_t mode) {
    volatile uint32_t *gpfsel = (uint32_t*)BCM2711_GPIO_BASE;
    // BCM2711-specific implementation
}

// platform/bcm2712/gpio_bcm2712.c  
static int bcm2712_gpio_set_mode(uint8_t pin, gpio_mode_t mode) {
    // RP1 I/O controller implementation
    return rp1_gpio_configure(pin, mode);
}

// Platform selection
extern const gpio_hal_t gpio_hal;
```

### Step 2: Update Build Configuration

```
"Update my CMakeLists.txt for dual BCM2711/BCM2712 support with proper platform selection and cross-compilation."
```

**Example CMake Configuration:**
```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt - Enhanced for dual platform support
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(sensor_monitor)

# Platform selection
set(TARGET_SOC "BCM2711" CACHE STRING "Target SoC (BCM2711 or BCM2712)")
set_property(CACHE TARGET_SOC PROPERTY STRINGS "BCM2711" "BCM2712")

# Cross-compilation setup
if(TARGET_SOC STREQUAL "BCM2711")
    set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
    set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR aarch64)
    set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER aarch64-linux-gnu-g++)
    add_definitions(-DTARGET_BCM2711)

    set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER aarch64-linux-gnu-g++)
    add_definitions(-DTARGET_BCM2712)
endif()

# Common source files
set(COMMON_SOURCES
    src/main.c
    src/sensor.c
    src/application.c
)

# HAL interface
set(HAL_SOURCES
    hal/gpio.c
    hal/spi.c
)

# Platform-specific sources
if(TARGET_SOC STREQUAL "BCM2711")
    set(PLATFORM_SOURCES
        platform/bcm2711/gpio_bcm2711.c
        platform/bcm2711/spi_bcm2711.c
        platform/bcm2711/platform_init.c
    )
    set(PLATFORM_INCLUDE platform/bcm2711/include)
elseif(TARGET_SOC STREQUAL "BCM2712")
    set(PLATFORM_SOURCES
        platform/bcm2712/gpio_bcm2712.c
        platform/bcm2712/spi_bcm2712.c
        platform/bcm2712/rp1_driver.c
        platform/bcm2712/platform_init.c
    )
    set(PLATFORM_INCLUDE platform/bcm2712/include)
endif()

# Create executable
add_executable(sensor_monitor
    ${COMMON_SOURCES}
    ${HAL_SOURCES}
    ${PLATFORM_SOURCES}
)

target_include_directories(sensor_monitor PRIVATE
    include
    hal/include
    ${PLATFORM_INCLUDE}
)

# Build commands for both platforms
add_custom_target(build-bcm2711
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -DTARGET_SOC=BCM2711 -B build-bcm2711 -S .
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} --build build-bcm2711
    COMMENT "Building for BCM2711"
)

add_custom_target(build-bcm2712
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -DTARGET_SOC=BCM2712 -B build-bcm2712 -S .
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} --build build-bcm2712
    COMMENT "Building for BCM2712"
)
```

### Step 3: Implement HAL Abstraction

```
"Create a complete HAL layer for SPI peripheral differences between BCM2711 and BCM2712. Include the RP1 I/O controller support."
```

**Example SPI HAL Implementation:**
```c
// hal/include/spi_hal.h - SPI HAL Interface
typedef struct {
    int (*init)(uint8_t bus, uint32_t speed_hz);
    int (*transfer)(const uint8_t *tx_buf, uint8_t *rx_buf, size_t len);
    int (*write)(const uint8_t *buf, size_t len);
    int (*read)(uint8_t *buf, size_t len);
    void (*cleanup)(void);
} spi_hal_t;

extern const spi_hal_t *spi_hal;

// platform/bcm2711/spi_bcm2711.c - BCM2711 Implementation
#define BCM2711_SPI0_BASE 0x7E204000

    volatile uint32_t *spi_base = (uint32_t*)BCM2711_SPI0_BASE;
    
    // Configure BCM2711 SPI controller
    uint32_t divider = 250000000 / speed_hz;  // Core clock / desired speed
    spi_base[SPI_CLK] = divider;
    spi_base[SPI_CS] = SPI_CS_CLEAR;
    
    return 0;
}

static int bcm2711_spi_transfer(const uint8_t *tx_buf, uint8_t *rx_buf, size_t len) {
    volatile uint32_t *spi_base = (uint32_t*)BCM2711_SPI0_BASE;
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        // Wait for TX ready
        while (!(spi_base[SPI_CS] & SPI_CS_TXD));
        spi_base[SPI_FIFO] = tx_buf ? tx_buf[i] : 0;
        
        // Wait for RX ready
        while (!(spi_base[SPI_CS] & SPI_CS_RXD));
        if (rx_buf) rx_buf[i] = spi_base[SPI_FIFO];
    }
    
    return 0;
}

const spi_hal_t bcm2711_spi_hal = {
    .init = bcm2711_spi_init,
    .transfer = bcm2711_spi_transfer,
    .write = bcm2711_spi_write,
    .read = bcm2711_spi_read,
    .cleanup = bcm2711_spi_cleanup
};

// platform/bcm2712/spi_bcm2712.c - BCM2712/RP1 Implementation
#include "rp1_driver.h"

static int bcm2712_spi_init(uint8_t bus, uint32_t speed_hz) {
    // Initialize RP1 I/O controller
    if (rp1_init() != 0) return -1;
    
    // Configure SPI through RP1
    rp1_spi_config_t config = {
        .bus = bus,
        .speed_hz = speed_hz,
        .mode = SPI_MODE_0,
        .bits_per_word = 8
    };
    
    return rp1_spi_configure(&config);
}

static int bcm2712_spi_transfer(const uint8_t *tx_buf, uint8_t *rx_buf, size_t len) {
    // Use RP1 SPI transfer function
    return rp1_spi_transfer(tx_buf, rx_buf, len);
}

const spi_hal_t bcm2712_spi_hal = {
    .init = bcm2712_spi_init,
    .transfer = bcm2712_spi_transfer,
    .write = bcm2712_spi_write,
    .read = bcm2712_spi_read,
    .cleanup = bcm2712_spi_cleanup
};

// Platform selection in hal/spi.c
#ifdef TARGET_BCM2711
const spi_hal_t *spi_hal = &bcm2711_spi_hal;
#elif defined(TARGET_BCM2712)
const spi_hal_t *spi_hal = &bcm2712_spi_hal;
#else
#error "No target platform defined"
#endif
```

## Planning

# Workflow 2: Migration Planning

**Goal:** Create a detailed migration strategy and timeline with risk assessment.

## Complete Example: Sensor Monitoring Application Migration

### Step 1: Generate Migration Plan

```
"Create a detailed migration plan from BCM2711 to BCM2712 for my sensor monitoring application. Include timeline, phases, and risk mitigation."
```

**Example Migration Plan:**
```
BCM2711 → BCM2712 Migration Plan
Application: Sensor Monitoring System

Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
├── Set up BCM2712 development environment
├── Create platform abstraction layer structure
├── Implement basic GPIO HAL for both platforms
└── Milestone: Dual-platform build system working

Phase 2: Core Migration (Week 3-4)
├── Migrate SPI driver to HAL abstraction
├── Update sensor communication layer
├── Implement RP1 I/O controller support
└── Milestone: Basic sensor reading works on both platforms

Phase 3: Optimization (Week 5-6)
├── Leverage Cortex-A76 performance improvements
├── Optimize memory access patterns
├── Update real-time scheduling for new CPU
└── Milestone: Performance targets met on BCM2712

Phase 4: Validation (Week 7-8)
├── Comprehensive testing on both platforms
├── Performance benchmarking
├── Long-term stability testing
└── Milestone: Production-ready dual-platform support

Risk Mitigation:
- Maintain BCM2711 compatibility throughout
- Feature flags for platform-specific optimizations
- Rollback plan if critical issues discovered
```

### Step 2: Risk Assessment

```
"What are the specific risks and compatibility issues for migrating my sensor monitoring application from BCM2711 to BCM2712?"
```

**Example Risk Assessment:**
```
Migration Risk Analysis:

HIGH RISK:
🔴 RP1 I/O Controller Changes
   Risk: GPIO/SPI access completely different on BCM2712
   Impact: Core functionality broken
   Mitigation: Comprehensive HAL abstraction, extensive testing

🔴 Real-time Timing Changes
   Risk: Cortex-A76 timing differs from Cortex-A72
   Impact: Sensor sampling rates affected
   Mitigation: Timing validation, adjustable parameters

MEDIUM RISK:
🟡 Memory Layout Differences
   Risk: Different memory mapping on BCM2712
   Impact: Direct memory access fails
   Mitigation: Use proper memory mapping APIs

🟡 Interrupt Handling Changes
   Risk: RP1 interrupt routing different
   Impact: Sensor interrupt handling broken
   Mitigation: Abstract interrupt handling in HAL

LOW RISK:
🟢 Application Logic
   Risk: Core sensor processing unchanged
   Impact: Minimal
   Mitigation: Standard testing procedures

🟢 Build System
   Risk: CMake already supports cross-compilation
   Impact: Minor configuration changes
   Mitigation: Platform-specific build targets
```

### Step 3: Performance Impact Analysis

```
"Analyze performance implications of migrating from Cortex-A72 to Cortex-A76. Focus on sensor processing and real-time requirements."
```

**Example Performance Analysis:**
```
Performance Impact Analysis: Cortex-A72 → Cortex-A76

CPU Performance:
  Single-thread: +35-40% improvement
  Multi-thread: +30-35% improvement
  Impact: Sensor processing can handle higher sample rates

Memory Performance:
  Bandwidth: +91% improvement (35GB/s → 67GB/s)
  Latency: ~15% improvement
  Impact: Faster data logging, reduced buffer requirements

Real-time Characteristics:
  Cache: Larger L2 cache (1MB → 2MB)
  Predictability: Similar interrupt latency
  Impact: More consistent real-time performance

Sensor Processing Improvements:
  Current: 1000 samples/sec maximum
  BCM2712: 1400+ samples/sec possible
  Headroom: 40% performance margin for future features

Power Consumption:
  Idle: Similar power draw
  Active: 10-15% higher due to higher performance
  Impact: May need thermal management updates

Optimization Opportunities:
  - SIMD improvements for sensor data processing
  - Better memory access patterns
  - Reduced CPU utilization for same workload
```

## Validation

# Workflow 4: Validation and Testing

**Goal:** Verify migration correctness and performance across both source and target platforms.

## Complete Example: Comprehensive Validation Process

### Step 1: Cross-Compilation Verification

```
"Help me set up comprehensive cross-compilation testing for both BCM2711 and BCM2712 platforms."
```

**Example Build and Test Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# validate_migration.sh - Comprehensive build validation

set -e  # Exit on any error

echo "=== ARM SoC Migration Validation ==="

# Clean previous builds
rm -rf build-bcm2711 build-bcm2712

# Build for BCM2711
echo "Building for BCM2711..."
cmake -DTARGET_SOC=BCM2711 -B build-bcm2711 -S .
cmake --build build-bcm2711 --parallel 4

# Build for BCM2712  
echo "Building for BCM2712..."
cmake -DTARGET_SOC=BCM2712 -B build-bcm2712 -S .
cmake --build build-bcm2712 --parallel 4

# Verify binaries
echo "Verifying binary architectures..."
file build-bcm2711/sensor_monitor
file build-bcm2712/sensor_monitor

# Check for platform-specific symbols
echo "Checking platform-specific symbols..."
nm build-bcm2711/sensor_monitor | grep -E "(bcm2711|rp1)" || echo "✅ No platform leakage in BCM2711 build"
nm build-bcm2712/sensor_monitor | grep -E "(bcm2711|rp1)" || echo "✅ Clean BCM2712 build"

# Size comparison
echo "Binary size comparison:"
ls -lh build-bcm2711/sensor_monitor build-bcm2712/sensor_monitor

echo "✅ Cross-compilation validation complete"
```

### Step 2: Performance Comparison

```
"Create a comprehensive performance benchmark comparing BCM2711 and BCM2712 builds. Focus on sensor processing throughput and real-time characteristics."
```

**Example Performance Benchmark:**
```c

        results.processing_time_us += proc_time;
        results.total_cycle_time_us += cycle_time;
        sample_count++;
        
        // Check if benchmark duration elapsed
        clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &end);
        if ((end.tv_sec - start.tv_sec) >= duration_seconds) break;

    results.cpu_utilization = (results.processing_time_us / 1000.0) * 100.0;
    
    return results;
}

// Example benchmark results comparison
void compare_platform_performance(void) {
    printf("=== Platform Performance Comparison ===\n");

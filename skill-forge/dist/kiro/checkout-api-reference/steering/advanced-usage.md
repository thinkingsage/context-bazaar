## Advanced Search Techniques

### Multi-Step Discovery Workflows

For complex integrations, use a systematic approach to discover and understand related operations:

1. **Domain Exploration**
   ```
   ListOperations with tag "Payments"
   ListOperations with tag "Workflows"
   ApiSearch for "webhook"
   ```

2. **Relationship Mapping**
   ```
   GetOperation for createPayment
   GetSchema for PaymentRequest
   GetSchema for PaymentResponse
   ApiSearch for "payment capture"
   ```

3. **Error Scenario Planning**
   ```
   ApiSearch for "void"
   ApiSearch for "refund"
   GetOperation for disputePayment
   ```

### Schema Deep Diving

Understanding complex data structures requires systematic schema exploration:

1. **Identify Core Schemas**
   ```
   GetSchema for PaymentRequest
   GetSchema for CustomerRequest
   GetSchema for WebhookEvent
   ```

2. **Explore Nested Objects**
   - `GetOperation` shows schema names referenced in request bodies
   - Use `GetSchema` to follow those references and understand full structures
   - Map required vs optional fields across related schemas

3. **Validate Data Flow**
   - Trace how data flows from request to response
   - Understand which response fields become input for subsequent operations
   - Identify shared data structures across operations

## Complex Integration Patterns

### Multi-Step Payment Flows

For sophisticated payment processing:

1. **Authorization and Capture Pattern**
   ```
   GetOperation for authorizePayment
   GetOperation for capturePayment
   GetSchema for AuthorizationRequest
   GetSchema for CaptureRequest
   ```

2. **Payment Instrument Management**
   ```
   ApiSearch for "instrument"
   GetOperation for createPaymentInstrument
   GetOperation for updatePaymentInstrument
   ```

3. **Recurring Payment Setup**
   ```
   ApiSearch for "recurring"
   ApiSearch for "subscription"
   GetSchema for RecurringPaymentRequest
   ```

### Platform and Marketplace Integrations

For multi-entity scenarios:

1. **Sub-Entity Management**
   ```
   ListOperations with tag "Platforms"
   GetOperation for createSubEntity
   GetSchema for SubEntityRequest
   ```

2. **Split Payment Scenarios**
   ```
   ApiSearch for "split"
   ApiSearch for "marketplace"
   GetSchema for SplitPaymentRequest
   ```

3. **Onboarding Workflows**
   ```
   ApiSearch for "onboard"
   GetOperation for uploadDocument
   GetSchema for OnboardingRequest
   ```

### Advanced Dispute Management

For comprehensive dispute handling:

1. **Dispute Lifecycle Management**
   ```
   GetOperation for getDispute
   GetOperation for acceptDispute
   GetOperation for provideDisputeEvidence
   GetSchema for DisputeEvidence
   ```

2. **Chargeback Prevention**
   ```
   ApiSearch for "alert"
   ApiSearch for "prevention"
   GetOperation for getDisputeAlert
   ```

## Workflow Automation Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture

Understanding webhook and event patterns:

1. **Event Type Discovery**
   ```
   DocsSearch for "webhook events"
   GetSchema for WebhookEvent
   ApiSearch for "event"
   ```

2. **Workflow Configuration**
   ```
   ListOperations with tag "Workflows"
   GetOperation for createWorkflow
   GetSchema for WorkflowRequest
   ```

### Identity Verification Workflows

For KYC and compliance:

1. **Verification Process Discovery**
   ```
   ListOperations with tag "Identity Verification"
   GetOperation for createIdentityVerification
   GetSchema for IdentityVerificationRequest
   ```

2. **Document Management**
   ```
   ApiSearch for "document"
   GetOperation for uploadDocument
   GetSchema for DocumentRequest
   ```

## Performance and Optimization

### Efficient Tool Usage

1. **Start with Search** - Use `ApiSearch` or `DocsSearch` to find relevant operations first
2. **Get Simplified Details** - `GetOperation` returns token-efficient responses (~300 tokens)
3. **Drill into Schemas** - Only call `GetSchema` when you need full data structure details
4. **Use Tag Filtering** - `ListOperations` with a tag is more efficient than broad searches

### Token-Efficient Workflows

The `GetOperation` tool returns simplified responses by default:
- Parameters show only name, location, required status, and type
- Request bodies show schema names with hints to use `GetSchema()`
- Responses are grouped into success/error code arrays
- Security shows only required scopes

This means a typical workflow uses ~300 tokens per operation lookup instead of ~1,200.

## Security and Compliance

### Authentication Deep Dive

1. **Auth Method Discovery**
   ```
   DocsSearch for "authentication"
   DocsSearch for "authorization"
   ```

2. **Token Management**
   ```
   ApiSearch for "token"
   GetOperation for createToken
   GetSchema for TokenRequest
   ```

### PCI and Compliance

1. **Secure Data Handling**
   ```
   DocsSearch for "PCI compliance"
   DocsSearch for "sensitive data"
   ```

2. **Audit and Logging**
   ```
   ApiSearch for "audit"
   ApiSearch for "log"
   ```

## Best Practices for Power Usage

### Systematic Exploration
- Always start with broad searches and narrow down
- Use schema exploration to understand data relationships
- Map complete workflows before implementation

### Continuous Learning
- Regularly explore new API areas as your integration grows
- Stay updated with new operations and schema changes
- Use the power to understand deprecation notices and migration paths

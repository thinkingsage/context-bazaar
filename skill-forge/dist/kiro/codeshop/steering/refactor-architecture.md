# Refactor Architecture

Surface architectural friction and propose deepening opportunities — refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability, informed by the domain language in CONTEXT.md and the decisions in docs/adr/.

## Adaptation Notes

- **Codebase exploration**: Use `invokeSubAgent` with the `context-gatherer` agent to walk the codebase organically, or use direct file exploration tools (`readCode`, `grepSearch`, `listDirectory`).
- **Cross-references**: See the challenge-domain-model steering file for context format details. See the challenge-domain-model steering file for ADR format details.

## When to Use

- The user wants to improve architecture or find refactoring opportunities
- The user wants to consolidate tightly-coupled modules
- The user wants to make a codebase more testable or AI-navigable
- The user mentions "deepening," "shallow modules," or "architectural friction"

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the project's codebase structure
- Optional: `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` if they exist (the workflow reads them but does not require them)

## Shared Concepts

This workflow relies on "deep modules" and "domain language discipline" as defined in the POWER.md Shared Concepts section. Deep modules have small interfaces hiding significant complexity. Domain language discipline means using terms from CONTEXT.md consistently in all suggestions and discussions.

## Glossary

Use these terms exactly in every suggestion. Consistent language is the point — don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary."

- **Module** — anything with an interface and an implementation (function, class, package, slice).
- **Interface** — everything a caller must know to use the module: types, invariants, error modes, ordering, config. Not just the type signature.
- **Implementation** — the code inside.
- **Depth** — leverage at the interface: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface. Deep = high leverage. Shallow = interface nearly as complex as the implementation.
- **Seam** — where an interface lives; a place behaviour can be altered without editing in place. (Use this, not "boundary.")
- **Adapter** — a concrete thing satisfying an interface at a seam.
- **Leverage** — what callers get from depth.
- **Locality** — what maintainers get from depth: change, bugs, knowledge concentrated in one place.

Key principles:

- **Deletion test**: imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it was a pass-through. If complexity reappears across N callers, it was earning its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.**
- **One adapter = hypothetical seam. Two adapters = real seam.**

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Explore
Read existing documentation (CONTEXT.md, ADRs), then walk the codebase organically. Note where you experience friction: shallow modules, leaky seams, untested code, tightly-coupled clusters.
→ Load `refactor-architecture-explore.md`

### Phase 2 — Present Candidates
Present a numbered list of deepening opportunities with files, problem, solution, and benefits explained in terms of locality and leverage. Do NOT propose interfaces yet.
→ Load `refactor-architecture-present.md`

### Phase 3 — Grilling Loop
Once the user picks a candidate, walk the design tree with them — constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened module, what sits behind the seam, what tests survive. Update CONTEXT.md and offer ADRs inline as decisions crystallize.
→ Load `refactor-architecture-grilling-loop.md`

## Appendix A: Architecture Language

Shared vocabulary for every suggestion this workflow makes. Use these terms exactly — don't substitute "component," "service," "API," or "boundary." Consistent language is the whole point.

### Terms

**Module**
Anything with an interface and an implementation. Deliberately scale-agnostic — applies equally to a function, class, package, or tier-spanning slice.
_Avoid_: unit, component, service.

**Interface**
Everything a caller must know to use the module correctly. Includes the type signature, but also invariants, ordering constraints, error modes, required configuration, and performance characteristics.
_Avoid_: API, signature (too narrow — those refer only to the type-level surface).

**Implementation**
What's inside a module — its body of code. Distinct from **Adapter**: a thing can be a small adapter with a large implementation (a Postgres repo) or a large adapter with a small implementation (an in-memory fake). Reach for "adapter" when the seam is the topic; "implementation" otherwise.

**Depth**
Leverage at the interface — the amount of behaviour a caller (or test) can exercise per unit of interface they have to learn. A module is **deep** when a large amount of behaviour sits behind a small interface. A module is **shallow** when the interface is nearly as complex as the implementation.

**Seam** _(from Michael Feathers)_
A place where you can alter behaviour without editing in that place. The *location* at which a module's interface lives. Choosing where to put the seam is its own design decision, distinct from what goes behind it.
_Avoid_: boundary (overloaded with DDD's bounded context).

**Adapter**
A concrete thing that satisfies an interface at a seam. Describes *role* (what slot it fills), not substance (what's inside).

**Leverage**
What callers get from depth. More capability per unit of interface they have to learn. One implementation pays back across N call sites and M tests.

**Locality**
What maintainers get from depth. Change, bugs, knowledge, and verification concentrate at one place rather than spreading across callers. Fix once, fixed everywhere.

### Principles

- **Depth is a property of the interface, not the implementation.** A deep module can be internally composed of small, mockable, swappable parts — they just aren't part of the interface. A module can have **internal seams** (private to its implementation, used by its own tests) as well as the **external seam** at its interface.
- **The deletion test.** Imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, the module wasn't hiding anything (it was a pass-through). If complexity reappears across N callers, the module was earning its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.** Callers and tests cross the same seam. If you want to test *past* the interface, the module is probably the wrong shape.
- **One adapter means a hypothetical seam. Two adapters means a real one.** Don't introduce a seam unless something actually varies across it.

### Relationships

- A **Module** has exactly one **Interface** (the surface it presents to callers and tests).
- **Depth** is a property of a **Module**, measured against its **Interface**.
- A **Seam** is where a **Module**'s **Interface** lives.
- An **Adapter** sits at a **Seam** and satisfies the **Interface**.
- **Depth** produces **Leverage** for callers and **Locality** for maintainers.

### Rejected Framings

- **Depth as ratio of implementation-lines to interface-lines** (Ousterhout): rewards padding the implementation. We use depth-as-leverage instead.
- **"Interface" as the TypeScript `interface` keyword or a class's public methods**: too narrow — interface here includes every fact a caller must know.
- **"Boundary"**: overloaded with DDD's bounded context. Say **seam** or **interface**.

## Appendix B: Deepening

How to deepen a cluster of shallow modules safely, given its dependencies. Assumes the vocabulary from Appendix A — **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**.

### Dependency Categories

When assessing a candidate for deepening, classify its dependencies. The category determines how the deepened module is tested across its seam.

#### 1. In-process

Pure computation, in-memory state, no I/O. Always deepenable — merge the modules and test through the new interface directly. No adapter needed.

#### 2. Local-substitutable

Dependencies that have local test stand-ins (PGLite for Postgres, in-memory filesystem). Deepenable if the stand-in exists. The deepened module is tested with the stand-in running in the test suite. The seam is internal; no port at the module's external interface.

#### 3. Remote but owned (Ports & Adapters)

Your own services across a network boundary (microservices, internal APIs). Define a **port** (interface) at the seam. The deep module owns the logic; the transport is injected as an **adapter**. Tests use an in-memory adapter. Production uses an HTTP/gRPC/queue adapter.

Recommendation shape: *"Define a port at the seam, implement an HTTP adapter for production and an in-memory adapter for testing, so the logic sits in one deep module even though it's deployed across a network."*

#### 4. True external (Mock)

Third-party services (Stripe, Twilio, etc.) you don't control. The deepened module takes the external dependency as an injected port; tests provide a mock adapter.

### Seam Discipline

- **One adapter means a hypothetical seam. Two adapters means a real one.** Don't introduce a port unless at least two adapters are justified (typically production + test). A single-adapter seam is just indirection.
- **Internal seams vs external seams.** A deep module can have internal seams (private to its implementation, used by its own tests) as well as the external seam at its interface. Don't expose internal seams through the interface just because tests use them.

### Testing Strategy: Replace, Don't Layer

- Old unit tests on shallow modules become waste once tests at the deepened module's interface exist — delete them.
- Write new tests at the deepened module's interface. The **interface is the test surface**.
- Tests assert on observable outcomes through the interface, not internal state.
- Tests should survive internal refactors — they describe behaviour, not implementation. If a test has to change when the implementation changes, it's testing past the interface.

## Appendix C: Interface Design

When the user wants to explore alternative interfaces for a chosen deepening candidate, use this parallel sub-agent pattern. Based on "Design It Twice" (Ousterhout) — your first idea is unlikely to be the best.

Uses the vocabulary from Appendix A — **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**.

### Process

#### 1. Frame the Problem Space

Before spawning sub-agents, write a user-facing explanation of the problem space for the chosen candidate:

- The constraints any new interface would need to satisfy
- The dependencies it would rely on, and which category they fall into (see Appendix B: Deepening)
- A rough illustrative code sketch to ground the constraints — not a proposal, just a way to make the constraints concrete

Show this to the user, then immediately proceed to Step 2. The user reads and thinks while the sub-agents work.

#### 2. Spawn Sub-Agents

Use `invokeSubAgent` with the `general-task-execution` agent to generate radically different interface designs. Each sub-agent receives a separate technical brief (file paths, coupling details, dependency category from Appendix B, what sits behind the seam). Give each agent a different design constraint:

- Agent 1: "Minimize the interface — aim for 1–3 entry points max. Maximise leverage per entry point."
- Agent 2: "Maximise flexibility — support many use cases and extension."
- Agent 3: "Optimise for the most common caller — make the default case trivial."
- Agent 4 (if applicable): "Design around ports & adapters for cross-seam dependencies."

Include both the architecture vocabulary (Appendix A) and CONTEXT.md vocabulary in the brief so each sub-agent names things consistently.

Each sub-agent outputs:

1. Interface (types, methods, params — plus invariants, ordering, error modes)
2. Usage example showing how callers use it
3. What the implementation hides behind the seam
4. Dependency strategy and adapters (see Appendix B)
5. Trade-offs — where leverage is high, where it's thin

#### 3. Present and Compare

Present designs sequentially so the user can absorb each one, then compare them in prose. Contrast by **depth** (leverage at the interface), **locality** (where change concentrates), and **seam placement**.

After comparing, give your own recommendation: which design you think is strongest and why. If elements from different designs would combine well, propose a hybrid. Be opinionated — the user wants a strong read, not a menu.

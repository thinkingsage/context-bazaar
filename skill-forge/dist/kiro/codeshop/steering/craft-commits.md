# Craft Commits

Write commit messages that tell the story of *why*, not just *what*. Every commit message is a letter to the next engineer — often yourself six months later.

## When to Use

- Committing code to any git repository
- The user asks for help writing a commit message
- Reviewing commit messages for quality

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Type** — one of: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`
**Scope** — the affected module, component, or domain (optional but recommended)
**Subject** — imperative mood, ≤72 chars, no trailing period
**Body** — *why* this change, not *what* (the diff already shows what)
**Footer** — breaking changes, issue refs (`Closes #123`, `BREAKING CHANGE: …`)

## The Rule of Thumb

If your subject line could apply to any commit in any codebase ("fix bug", "update code", "improvements"), rewrite it. A good subject makes sense without the diff.

## Examples

### Good

```
feat(auth): add PKCE flow for public OAuth clients

The previous implicit flow leaks access tokens in browser history.
PKCE (RFC 7636) resolves this without requiring a client secret.

Closes #418
```

```
refactor(catalog): extract scanSourceDir for multi-root support

The previous implementation hardcoded 'knowledge/' as the only
source root, preventing packages/ from being scanned. Now each
source root is processed through the same layout-detection logic.
```

```
fix(wizard): default maturity field to experimental

New artifacts omitted maturity from their frontmatter, causing
catalog validation warnings on first forge build. The wizard now
sets maturity: experimental by default.
```

### Bad

- `WIP` — if it's not ready, keep it on a branch
- `misc fixes` — be specific; if there are many fixes, write many commits
- `added auth module` — past tense; use imperative ("add auth module")
- `changed foo to bar in config` — summarizes the diff; explain the motivation instead

## Anti-Patterns

- **WIP commits**: If it's not ready, keep it on a branch. Don't pollute the main history.
- **Catch-all commits**: "misc fixes", "updates", "improvements" — be specific. If there are many changes, write many commits.
- **Past tense**: "added X", "fixed Y" — use imperative mood: "add X", "fix Y".
- **Diff summaries**: "changed foo to bar" — the diff already shows what changed. Explain *why*.
- **Compound commits**: If you need "and" in your subject line, split the commit. Each commit should be one logical change.

## Body Guidelines

The body should explain *why* the change was made. The diff already shows *what* changed. If your body reads like a changelog, rewrite it as motivation:

- What problem does this solve?
- Why this approach over alternatives?
- What context would a future reader need?

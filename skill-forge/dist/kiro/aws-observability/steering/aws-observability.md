## Alerting Setup

# Intelligent Alerting Setup

## Purpose
This steering file provides guidance for setting up effective CloudWatch alarms using recommended configurations and best practices.

## Core Concepts

### Alarm States
- **OK**: Metric is within acceptable threshold
- **ALARM**: Metric has breached threshold
- **INSUFFICIENT_DATA**: Not enough data to evaluate

### Alarm Components
- **Metric**: What to monitor (CPU, errors, latency, etc.)
- **Statistic**: How to aggregate (Average, Sum, Maximum, percentiles)
- **Threshold**: Value that triggers alarm
- **Evaluation Period**: How long to evaluate
- **Datapoints to Alarm**: How many periods must breach

### Alarm Types
- **Metric Alarm**: Based on single CloudWatch metric
- **Composite Alarm**: Combines multiple alarms with logic (AND, OR, NOT)
- **Anomaly Detection Alarm**: Uses ML to detect unusual patterns

## Getting Recommended Alarm Configurations

### Using get_recommended_metric_alarms

The power includes intelligent alarm recommendations based on AWS best practices:

```
Tool: get_recommended_metric_alarms

Parameters:
  - namespace: AWS service namespace (e.g., "AWS/Lambda")
  - metric_name: Metric to monitor (e.g., "Errors")
  - dimensions: Resource identifiers
  - statistic: Appropriate statistic for metric type

Returns:
  - Recommended threshold values
  - Evaluation periods
  - Datapoints to alarm
  - Alarm description
  - Rationale for recommendations
```

### Choosing the Right Statistic

**Critical Rule**: The statistic must match the metric type:

**Count Metrics** (use `Sum`):
- Errors, Faults, Throttles
- Invocations, RequestCount
- CacheHits, CacheMisses
- Connections, EventsProcessed

**Utilization Metrics** (use `Average`):
- CPUUtilization, MemoryUtilization
- DiskUtilization, NetworkUtilization
- DatabaseConnections (as percentage)

**Latency/Time Metrics** (use `Average` or percentiles):
- Duration, Latency, ResponseTime
- ProcessingTime, ExecutionTime
- Delay, WaitTime

**Size Metrics** (use `Average`):
- PayloadSize, MessageSize
- RequestSize, BodySize

## Alarm Configuration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Lambda Function Errors

**Recommended Configuration**:
```
Metric: AWS/Lambda - Errors
Statistic: Sum
Threshold: > 5 errors
Evaluation Period: 5 minutes
Datapoints to Alarm: 2 out of 3
Treat Missing Data: notBreaching

Rationale:
- Sum is correct for count metrics
- 5 errors allows for occasional failures
- 2 out of 3 reduces false positives
- 5-minute periods balance responsiveness and stability
```

**Example**:
```
get_recommended_metric_alarms(
  namespace="AWS/Lambda",
  metric_name="Errors",
  dimensions=[{name: "FunctionName", value: "my-function"}],
  statistic="Sum"
)
```

### Pattern 2: EC2 CPU Utilization

**Recommended Configuration**:
```
Metric: AWS/EC2 - CPUUtilization
Statistic: Average
Threshold: > 80%
Evaluation Period: 5 minutes
Datapoints to Alarm: 3 out of 3
Treat Missing Data: notBreaching

Rationale:
- Average smooths out spikes
- 80% allows for burst capacity
- 3 out of 3 ensures sustained high CPU
- Prevents alarms during brief spikes
```

### Pattern 3: API Gateway Latency

**Recommended Configuration**:
```
Metric: AWS/ApiGateway - Latency
Statistic: p99 (99th percentile)
Threshold: > 1000ms
Evaluation Period: 5 minutes
Datapoints to Alarm: 2 out of 3
Treat Missing Data: notBreaching

Rationale:
- p99 catches tail latency issues
- 1000ms threshold for user experience
- 2 out of 3 balances sensitivity
- Focuses on worst-case performance
```

### Pattern 4: RDS Database Connections

**Recommended Configuration**:
```
Metric: AWS/RDS - DatabaseConnections
Statistic: Average
Threshold: > 80% of max_connections
Evaluation Period: 5 minutes
Datapoints to Alarm: 3 out of 3
Treat Missing Data: notBreaching

Rationale:
- Average shows sustained connection usage
- 80% threshold provides buffer
- 3 out of 3 ensures real issue
- Prevents connection pool exhaustion
```

### Pattern 5: DynamoDB Throttles

**Recommended Configuration**:
```
Metric: AWS/DynamoDB - UserErrors
Statistic: Sum
Threshold: > 10 errors
Evaluation Period: 1 minute
Datapoints to Alarm: 2 out of 2
Treat Missing Data: notBreaching

Rationale:
- Sum is correct for error counts
- 10 errors indicates capacity issue
- 1-minute periods for quick detection
- 2 out of 2 confirms sustained throttling
```

## Composite Alarms

### Use Cases for Composite Alarms

**Scenario 1: Service Health**
Combine multiple metrics to determine overall service health:

```
Composite Alarm: "api-service-unhealthy"

Logic: (high-error-rate OR high-latency) AND low-success-rate

Component Alarms:
  - high-error-rate: Errors > 5%
  - high-latency: p99 Latency > 2000ms
  - low-success-rate: Success rate < 95%

Rationale: Service is unhealthy if errors OR latency are high AND success rate is low
```

**Scenario 2: Dependency Failure**
Detect when a service and its dependencies are failing:

```
Composite Alarm: "service-and-dependency-down"

Logic: service-errors AND (database-errors OR cache-errors)

Component Alarms:
  - service-errors: Lambda Errors > 10
  - database-errors: RDS CPUUtilization > 90%
  - cache-errors: ElastiCache Evictions > 1000

Rationale: Service errors combined with dependency issues indicate cascading failure
```

## Anomaly Detection Alarms

### When to Use Anomaly Detection

**Good Use Cases**:
- Metrics with predictable patterns (daily, weekly cycles)
- Metrics where absolute thresholds are hard to define
- Detecting unusual behavior vs normal patterns

**Example: Request Count Anomaly**:
```
Metric: AWS/ApiGateway - Count
Anomaly Detection: Enabled
Threshold: 2 standard deviations
Evaluation Period: 10 minutes

Rationale:
- Request patterns vary by time of day
- Anomaly detection learns normal patterns
- 2 std dev catches significant deviations
- Adapts to traffic growth over time
```

## Alarm Best Practices

### 1. Alarm Naming Convention

Use descriptive, consistent names:
```
Format: [severity]-[service]-[metric]-[condition]

Examples:
- critical-api-error-rate-high
- warning-lambda-duration-p99-high
- info-rds-connections-approaching-limit
```

### 2. Alarm Descriptions

Include actionable information:
```
Description Template:
"[Service] [Metric] is [Condition]. 
Current value: {{value}} {{unit}}
Threshold: {{threshold}} {{unit}}
Runbook: [link to runbook]
Dashboard: [link to dashboard]"

Example:
"API Gateway error rate is above 5%.
Current value: 8.2%
Threshold: 5%
Runbook: https://wiki.company.com/runbooks/api-errors
Dashboard: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/dashboards/api-health"
```

### 3. Alarm Actions

Configure appropriate actions for each severity:

**Critical Alarms**:
- Page on-call engineer (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
- Post to critical alerts channel (Slack, Teams)
- Create high-priority ticket

**Warning Alarms**:
- Post to team channel
- Create normal-priority ticket
- Email team distribution list

**Info Alarms**:
- Log to monitoring system
- Email individual owner
- No immediate action required

### 4. Treat Missing Data

Choose appropriate behavior:

- **notBreaching**: Use for most alarms (default)
- **breaching**: Use when missing data indicates problem
- **ignore**: Use when data is expected to be sparse
- **missing**: Treat as INSUFFICIENT_DATA

### 5. Evaluation Periods

Balance responsiveness vs stability:

**Fast Detection** (1-2 minutes):
- Critical services
- User-facing errors
- Security events

**Balanced** (5 minutes):
- Most application metrics
- Resource utilization
- Performance metrics

**Slow Detection** (10-15 minutes):
- Cost metrics
- Capacity planning
- Trend analysis

## SLO-Based Alerting

### Integrating with Application Signals SLOs

**Approach**: Use SLO error budget consumption for alerting

**Example: Availability SLO**:
```
SLO: 99.9% availability (30-day window)
Error Budget: 0.1% = 43.2 minutes downtime/month

Alerts:
1. Warning: 50% error budget consumed (21.6 min)
2. Critical: 80% error budget consumed (34.6 min)
3. Emergency: 100% error budget consumed (43.2 min)

Actions:
- Warning: Notify team, review recent changes
- Critical: Page on-call, implement feature freeze
- Emergency: All hands, immediate mitigation
```

**Implementation**:
```
1. Set up SLO in Application Signals
2. Create CloudWatch alarm on error budget metric
3. Configure multi-level thresholds
4. Link to incident response procedures
```

## Alarm Tuning and Maintenance

### Reducing False Positives

**Symptoms**:
- Alarms trigger frequently but no real issue
- Team ignores alarms (alarm fatigue)
- Alarms trigger during known maintenance

**Solutions**:

1. **Adjust Thresholds**:
   - Review alarm history
   - Analyze metric patterns
   - Increase threshold if too sensitive
   - Use percentiles instead of max/min

2. **Increase Datapoints to Alarm**:
   - Change from 1 out of 1 to 2 out of 3
   - Requires sustained breach
   - Reduces transient spikes

3. **Use Composite Alarms**:
   - Combine multiple signals
   - Require multiple conditions
   - More accurate detection

4. **Implement Maintenance Windows**:
   - Suppress alarms during deployments
   - Use CloudWatch alarm actions
   - Document maintenance schedules

### Handling Alarm Flapping

**Symptoms**:
- Alarm rapidly switches between OK and ALARM
- Metric oscillates around threshold
- Unclear if real issue exists

**Solutions**:

1. **Increase Evaluation Period**:
   - Use longer time windows
   - Smooth out oscillations
   - Focus on sustained issues

2. **Add Hysteresis**:
   - Use different thresholds for alarm and recovery
   - Example: Alarm at 80%, recover at 70%
   - Prevents rapid state changes

3. **Use Anomaly Detection**:
   - Adapts to metric patterns
   - Less sensitive to threshold proximity
   - Better for variable metrics

## Alarm Testing

### Validating Alarm Configuration

**Test Checklist**:
- [ ] Alarm triggers when metric breaches threshold
- [ ] Alarm recovers when metric returns to normal
- [ ] Alarm actions execute correctly (notifications sent)
- [ ] Alarm description is clear and actionable
- [ ] Runbook link works and is up-to-date
- [ ] On-call receives notification within SLA

**Testing Approaches**:

1. **Synthetic Testing**:
   - Inject errors or load
   - Verify alarm triggers
   - Confirm notifications

2. **Historical Analysis**:
   - Review past incidents
   - Check if alarm would have triggered
   - Adjust configuration if needed

3. **Chaos Engineering**:
   - Deliberately cause failures
   - Validate detection and alerting
   - Test incident response procedures

## Integration with Incident Response

### Alarm-Driven Workflows

**Workflow 1: Alarm Triggers Investigation**:
```
1. Alarm triggers → Notification sent
2. On-call checks alarm details
3. Query CloudWatch Logs for errors
4. Analyze Application Signals traces
5. Check CloudTrail for recent changes (use data source priority)
6. Implement mitigation
7. Update alarm if needed
```

**Workflow 2: Proactive Monitoring**:
```
1. Review alarm history daily
2. Identify patterns and trends
3. Tune thresholds before issues occur
4. Add missing alarms for gaps
5. Document learnings in runbooks
```

## Quick Reference

## Cloudtrail Data Source Selection

# CloudTrail Data Source Selection Strategy

## Purpose
This is a utility guide referenced by `security-auditing.md` and other steering files for CloudTrail data access priority logic. It is not intended to be loaded directly in response to user queries. For CloudTrail security analysis, use `security-auditing.md` instead.

This steering file defines the priority order for accessing CloudTrail audit data across different AWS services. It ensures the agent always uses the most efficient and comprehensive data source available.

## Data Source Priority

When CloudTrail or security auditing data is needed, follow this priority order:

### Priority 1: CloudTrail Lake (Event Data Store)
**Check First**: Use CloudTrail MCP server to check for CloudTrail Lake event data stores

**Tool**: `list_event_data_stores` from CloudTrail MCP server

**When to Use**:
- Event data store exists with management events enabled
- Provides SQL-based querying with advanced filtering
- Best for complex queries and long-term retention
- Most cost-effective for large-scale analysis

**Advantages**:
- Native SQL support for complex queries
- 7-year retention by default
- Cross-account and cross-region aggregation
- Advanced filtering and partitioning
- Lower query costs for large datasets

**Example Check**:
```
Use CloudTrail MCP server's list_event_data_stores tool to check if any event data stores exist with:
- Status: ENABLED
- AdvancedEventSelectors configured for management events
```

### Priority 2: CloudWatch Logs (CloudTrail Integration)
**Check Second**: If no CloudTrail Lake event data store, check CloudWatch Logs

**Tool**: `describe_log_groups` from CloudWatch MCP server

**When to Use**:
- CloudTrail is configured to send events to CloudWatch Logs
- Log group exists with "cloudtrail" in the name
- Good for real-time analysis and alerting
- Integrates with CloudWatch Alarms

**Advantages**:
- Real-time event streaming
- CloudWatch Logs Insights query support
- Integration with CloudWatch Alarms and metrics
- Cross-service log correlation
- Familiar CloudWatch Logs interface

**Common Log Group Patterns**:
- `/aws/cloudtrail/logs`
- `/aws/cloudtrail/<trail-name>`
- `CloudTrail/logs`
- `<organization-name>-cloudtrail`
- Any log group with "cloudtrail" in the name

**Example Check**:
```
Use CloudWatch MCP server's describe_log_groups tool with:
- log_group_name_prefix: "/aws/cloudtrail" or search for "cloudtrail"
```

### Priority 3: CloudTrail Lookup Events API
**Fallback**: If neither CloudTrail Lake nor CloudWatch Logs available

**Tool**: `lookup_events` from CloudTrail MCP server

**When to Use**:
- No CloudTrail Lake event data store configured
- CloudTrail not sending to CloudWatch Logs
- Quick lookups for recent events (last 90 days)
- Simple queries without complex filtering

**Limitations**:
- Only last 90 days of events
- Limited to 50 results per API call
- Basic filtering capabilities
- Higher API costs for large queries
- No SQL support

**Advantages**:
- Always available if CloudTrail is enabled
- No additional configuration required
- Simple API for basic queries
- Good for quick investigations

**Example Usage**:
```
Use CloudTrail MCP server's lookup_events tool with:
- StartTime and EndTime for date range
- LookupAttributes for filtering (EventName, Username, ResourceName, etc.)
- MaxResults for pagination
```

## Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Check CloudTrail Lake
```
1. Call list_event_data_stores from CloudTrail MCP server
2. Check if any event data stores exist with:
   - Status = ENABLED
   - Management events enabled in AdvancedEventSelectors
3. If found, use CloudTrail Lake for queries
   - Use lake_query for SQL-based analysis
   - Leverage advanced filtering and aggregation
```

### Step 2: Check CloudWatch Logs (if Step 1 fails)
```
1. Call describe_log_groups from CloudWatch MCP server
2. Search for log groups with "cloudtrail" in the name
3. If found, use CloudWatch Logs Insights
   - Use execute_log_insights_query for analysis
   - Leverage CloudWatch Logs query syntax
   - Set up alarms if needed
```

### Step 3: Use Lookup Events API (if Steps 1 and 2 fail)
```
1. Use lookup_events from CloudTrail MCP server
2. Apply basic filtering with LookupAttributes
3. Paginate through results if needed
4. Note: Limited to last 90 days and 50 results per call
```

## Decision Tree

```
Need CloudTrail Data?
    |
    v
Check CloudTrail Lake (list_event_data_stores)
    |
    +-- Event Data Store Enabled? --> YES --> Use CloudTrail Lake (lake_query)
    |
    +-- NO
        |
        v
    Check CloudWatch Logs (describe_log_groups)
        |
        +-- CloudTrail Log Group Exists? --> YES --> Use CloudWatch Logs (execute_log_insights_query)
        |
        +-- NO
            |
            v
        Use CloudTrail Lookup Events API (lookup_events)
            |
            v
        Limited to 90 days, basic filtering
```

## Query Translation Examples

### Example 1: Find IAM User Deletions

**CloudTrail Lake (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT 
    eventTime,
    userIdentity.userName,
    requestParameters.userName AS deletedUser,
    sourceIPAddress
FROM <event_data_store_id>
WHERE eventName = 'DeleteUser'
    AND eventTime > timestamp '2024-01-01 00:00:00'
ORDER BY eventTime DESC
```

**CloudWatch Logs Insights**:
```
fields eventTime, userIdentity.userName, requestParameters.userName, sourceIPAddress
| filter eventName = "DeleteUser"
| filter @timestamp > "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 50
```

**Lookup Events API**:
```
lookup_events(
    LookupAttributes=[
        {
            'AttributeKey': 'EventName',
            'AttributeValue': 'DeleteUser'
        }
    ],
    StartTime='2024-01-01T00:00:00Z',
    MaxResults=50
)
```

### Example 2: Track S3 Bucket Deletions

**CloudTrail Lake (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT 
    eventTime,
    userIdentity.principalId,
    requestParameters.bucketName,
    sourceIPAddress,
    errorCode
FROM <event_data_store_id>
WHERE eventName = 'DeleteBucket'
    AND eventTime > timestamp '2024-01-01 00:00:00'
ORDER BY eventTime DESC
```

**CloudWatch Logs Insights**:
```
fields eventTime, userIdentity.principalId, requestParameters.bucketName, sourceIPAddress, errorCode
| filter eventName = "DeleteBucket"
| filter @timestamp > "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 50
```

**Lookup Events API**:
```
lookup_events(
    LookupAttributes=[
        {
            'AttributeKey': 'EventName',
            'AttributeValue': 'DeleteBucket'
        }
    ],
    StartTime='2024-01-01T00:00:00Z',
    MaxResults=50
)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Check in Priority Order
- Start with CloudTrail Lake for best performance and cost
- Fall back to CloudWatch Logs for real-time analysis
- Use Lookup Events API only as last resort

### 2. Cache Data Source Discovery
- Once you've identified the available data source, remember it for the session
- Don't re-check on every query unless explicitly needed

### 3. Choose the Right Tool for the Job
- **Complex Analysis**: CloudTrail Lake (SQL support)
- **Real-time Alerting**: CloudWatch Logs (alarm integration)
- **Quick Lookups**: Lookup Events API (simple queries)

### 4. Consider Time Range
- **> 90 days**: Must use CloudTrail Lake or CloudWatch Logs
- **< 90 days**: All three options available
- **Real-time**: CloudWatch Logs preferred

### 5. Query Optimization
- **CloudTrail Lake**: Use SQL optimizations (WHERE clauses, partitioning)
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Use indexed fields, limit time ranges
- **Lookup Events**: Use specific LookupAttributes to reduce results

## Error Handling

### CloudTrail Lake Not Available
```
If list_event_data_stores returns empty or no enabled stores:
- Log: "CloudTrail Lake not configured, checking CloudWatch Logs"
- Proceed to Priority 2
```

### CloudWatch Logs Not Available
```
If describe_log_groups finds no CloudTrail log groups:
- Log: "CloudTrail not integrated with CloudWatch Logs, using Lookup Events API"
- Proceed to Priority 3
```

### Lookup Events API Limitations
```
If query requires:
- Data older than 90 days: Inform user CloudTrail Lake or CloudWatch Logs needed
- Complex filtering: Suggest enabling CloudTrail Lake
- Large result sets: Warn about pagination and API costs
```

## Migration Recommendations

If using Lookup Events API, recommend:

1. **Enable CloudTrail Lake** for:
   - Long-term retention (7 years)
   - Complex SQL queries
   - Cost-effective large-scale analysis
   - Cross-account aggregation

2. **Enable CloudWatch Logs Integration** for:
   - Real-time monitoring
   - CloudWatch Alarms
   - Log correlation with applications
   - Familiar CloudWatch interface

## Summary

This priority-based approach ensures:
- ✅ Most efficient data source is used first
- ✅ Graceful fallback to available alternatives
- ✅ Clear guidance for users on capabilities
- ✅ Cost optimization through appropriate tool selection
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all steering files

---

**Remember**: Always check data sources in priority order (CloudTrail Lake → CloudWatch Logs → Lookup Events API) to ensure optimal performance and cost efficiency.

### Example: Complete Incident Investigation

**Scenario**: API returning 500 errors

**Step 1: Check Alarms**
```
Query: get_active_alarms(state_value="ALARM")
Result: "api-error-rate" alarm in ALARM state
```

**Step 2: Check Application Signals**
For detailed Application Signals patterns and APM deep-dive, see `performance-monitoring.md`.
```
Query: audit_services(
  service_targets='[{"Type":"service","Data":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"*"}}}]'
)
Result: "api-service" flagged with 15% error rate (normal: 0.1%)
```

**Step 3: Query Logs**
```
fields @timestamp, @message, errorType, requestId, traceId
| filter level = "ERROR"
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 100
```

**Step 4: Analyze Traces**
For detailed trace analysis patterns, see `performance-monitoring.md`.
```
Query: search_transaction_spans(
  query_string='FILTER attributes.aws.local.service = "api-service"
    and attributes.http.status_code >= 500
    | LIMIT 20'
)
Result: Traces show timeout calling database
```

**Step 5: Check Metrics**
```
Query: get_metric_data(
  namespace="AWS/RDS",
  metric_name="CPUUtilization",
  dimensions=[{name: "DBInstanceIdentifier", value: "prod-db"}]
)
Result: Database CPU at 95%
```

**Step 6: Check CloudTrail for Changes**
```
# Follow CloudTrail data source priority (see cloudtrail-data-source-selection.md)
# For detailed CloudTrail query patterns and security analysis, see security-auditing.md.
#
# 1. Check CloudTrail Lake (if available)
# 2. Check CloudWatch Logs (if CloudTrail integrated)
# 3. Use Lookup Events API (fallback)
#
# Query for recent changes to the affected service (e.g., RDS):
# - Filter by eventSource for the relevant AWS service
# - Sort by eventTime descending to find recent changes

Result: No recent database changes
```

**Step 7: Check Logs for Query Patterns**
For detailed log query patterns including duration parsing, see `log-analysis.md`.
```
# Analyze slow query patterns - parse SQL and duration from logs,
# aggregate by query to find the most frequent/slowest patterns.
# See log-analysis.md for parse and stats syntax reference.

Result: N+1 query pattern detected - 10,000+ queries for single API request
```

**Step 8: Root Cause**
```
Finding: New feature deployed 1 hour ago
Issue: N+1 query problem causing excessive database load
Evidence: 10,000+ queries for single API request
```

**Step 9: Mitigation**
```
Action: Rollback deployment
Verification: Error rate returns to normal
Follow-up: Fix N+1 query, add database query monitoring
```

## Log Analysis

# CloudWatch Logs Insights Analysis Steering

## Purpose
This steering file provides guidance for using CloudWatch Logs Insights QL syntax for log analysis, troubleshooting, and data extraction via the CloudWatch MCP server.

## MCP Server Tools

### Primary Tools
- `execute_log_insights_query` - Run Logs Insights queries with automatic polling
- `describe_log_groups` - Discover log groups and saved queries
- `analyze_log_group` - Detect anomalies and common patterns
- `get_logs_insight_query_results` - Retrieve results from timed-out queries
- `cancel_logs_insight_query` - Cancel running queries

### Key Parameters for execute_log_insights_query
- `query_string` - The Logs Insights QL query
- `log_group_names` OR `log_group_identifiers` - Target log groups (exactly one required)
- `start_time` / `end_time` - ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2025-02-06T10:00:00+00:00")
- `limit` - Max results (CRITICAL: always use to avoid context overflow)

## Query Construction Principles

### 1. Always Limit Results
Every query should include a limit to avoid overwhelming context:
```
fields @timestamp, @message
| limit 50
```

### 2. Use Pipe Syntax
Commands are separated by pipe (`|`) characters:
```
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 100
```

### 3. Built-in Fields Use @ Prefix
CloudWatch auto-discovers these fields:
- `@timestamp` - Log event timestamp
- `@message` - Raw log message
- `@logStream` - Log stream name
- `@log` - Log group identifier
- `@ingestionTime` - When CloudWatch received the event

### 4. Comments Use Hash
```
# This is a comment
fields @timestamp, @message
| limit 50
```

## Core Commands

### fields
Select and transform fields:
```
fields @timestamp, @message, @logStream
fields @timestamp, concat(@logStream, '-', @message) as combined
```

### filter
Filter log events:
```
filter @message like /ERROR/
filter @message like /(?i)exception/
filter statusCode >= 400
filter ispresent(requestId)
filter @message not like /DEBUG/
```

### stats
Aggregate statistics:
```
stats count(*) by bin(1h)
stats avg(duration), max(duration), min(duration) by serviceName
stats count(*) as errorCount by errorType
| sort errorCount desc
```

### parse
Extract fields from messages:
```
# Glob pattern
parse @message "user=* action=* status=*" as user, action, status

# Regex pattern

## Best Practices

1. **Start with describe_log_groups** - Discover available log groups first
2. **Use narrow time ranges** - Minimize scanned data and costs
3. **Always include limit** - Prevent context window overflow
4. **Test incrementally** - Start simple, add complexity
5. **Use filterIndex for indexed fields** - Improves performance on large datasets
6. **Parse JSON early** - Extract fields before filtering when possible
7. **Use analyze_log_group** - For quick anomaly and pattern detection

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing limit** - Queries can return massive results
2. **Wrong time format** - Use ISO 8601 with timezone
3. **Case sensitivity** - Field names and regex are case-sensitive
4. **Missing ispresent()** - Filter on field existence before using it
5. **Regex escaping** - Use `/pattern/` syntax, escape special chars
6. **Large time ranges** - Can be slow and expensive

## Query Construction Workflow

When a user asks for log analysis:

1. **Discover log groups** - Use `describe_log_groups` if unknown
2. **Define time range** - Ask for or suggest appropriate window
3. **Identify requirements** - What fields, filters, aggregations?
4. **Build query** - Start simple, use patterns above
5. **Add limit** - Always cap results (50-100 typical)
6. **Execute and iterate** - Refine based on results

---

**Remember**: Always include a `limit` clause to avoid overwhelming the agent context. Start with 50-100 results and increase if needed.

## Observability Gap Analysis

# Codebase Observability Gap Analysis Steering

## Purpose
This steering file provides guidance for analyzing codebases across major programming languages to identify observability gaps and provide actionable recommendations for instrumentation, logging, metrics, and tracing.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Logging Analysis
Identify gaps in logging coverage:

**What to Check:**
- Error handling blocks without logging
- Critical operations without audit logs
- Missing structured logging (JSON format)
- Inconsistent log levels
- Missing correlation IDs/request IDs
- Sensitive data in logs (PII, credentials)
- Missing context (user, session, transaction)

**Recommendations:**
- Use structured logging libraries (e.g., structlog, logrus, winston)
- Add correlation IDs to all log entries
- Log at appropriate levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- Include contextual metadata (service, version, environment)
- Sanitize sensitive data before logging

**Cost Optimization:**
- Set production log level to INFO or WARN (avoid DEBUG in production)
- Use log sampling for high-throughput operations (e.g., log 1 in 100 requests)
- Configure CloudWatch log retention policies (7-30 days for most use cases)
- Use metric filters instead of logging for high-frequency counters
- Avoid logging in hot paths (tight loops, per-item processing)
- Consider log aggregation before shipping (batch similar events)
- Use EMF (Embedded Metric Format) for Lambda to reduce log volume

### 2. Metrics Collection
Assess metrics instrumentation:

**What to Check:**
- Missing business metrics (orders, signups, conversions)
- No performance metrics (latency, throughput)
- Missing resource utilization metrics
- No error rate tracking
- Missing custom CloudWatch metrics
- No metric dimensions for filtering

**Recommendations:**
- Instrument key business operations
- Track request duration and count
- Monitor error rates by type
- Add custom CloudWatch metrics for business KPIs
- Use metric dimensions (service, endpoint, status)
- Implement metric aggregation for high-volume operations

**Cost Optimization:**
- Limit metric dimensions to avoid cardinality explosion (max 10 dimensions per metric)
- Use metric aggregation at source before publishing to CloudWatch
- Leverage EMF (Embedded Metric Format) for Lambda to reduce API calls
- Set appropriate metric resolution (standard 1-min vs high-res 1-sec)
- Use metric math in dashboards instead of creating derived metrics
- Implement local aggregation for high-frequency metrics (>1000/sec)
- Consider StatsD/DogStatsD for local aggregation before CloudWatch

### 3. Distributed Tracing
Evaluate tracing implementation:

**What to Check:**
- Missing OpenTelemetry SDK integration
- No trace context propagation (W3C Trace Context)
- Missing spans for external calls
- No span attributes for business context
- Missing span events for debugging
- No sampling strategy
- Legacy X-Ray SDK without OTEL migration path

**Recommendations:**
- Use OpenTelemetry (OTEL) for instrumentation (vendor-neutral, industry standard)
- Deploy AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) as the collector
- Enable AWS Application Signals for automatic APM (built on OTEL)
- Propagate trace context across service boundaries (W3C Trace Context)
- Create spans for database, HTTP, and AWS SDK calls
- Add span attributes for searchable context
- Include span events for debugging details
- Implement adaptive sampling for high-volume services
- For existing X-Ray implementations: Plan migration to OTEL with X-Ray exporter

**Application Signals Benefits:**
- Automatic service discovery and dependency mapping
- Pre-built dashboards for service health (latency, errors, availability)
- SLO tracking and error budget monitoring
- Correlation between traces, metrics, and logs
- No code changes required (auto-instrumentation via ADOT)
- Built on OpenTelemetry standards

**Cost Optimization:**
- Implement head-based sampling (sample at trace start, not per-span)
- Use adaptive sampling rules (higher rate for errors, lower for success)
- Configure sampling rates based on traffic volume (1% for high-volume, 100% for low-volume)
- Avoid tracing health check endpoints
- Use tail-based sampling for critical transactions only
- Leverage ADOT collector for local aggregation and filtering

### 4. Error Handling
Review error handling patterns:

**What to Check:**
- Silent failures (empty catch blocks)
- Generic error messages
- Missing error context
- No error categorization
- Missing retry logic
- No circuit breaker patterns

**Recommendations:**
- Log all errors with full context
- Use specific error types/classes
- Include stack traces for debugging
- Categorize errors (transient, permanent, user)
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Add circuit breakers for external dependencies

### 5. Health Checks & Readiness
Assess service health endpoints:

**What to Check:**
- Missing health check endpoints
- No readiness probes
- Incomplete dependency checks
- No graceful shutdown handling
- Missing startup probes

**Recommendations:**
- Implement `/health` endpoint
- Add `/ready` endpoint with dependency checks
- Include version and build info
- Implement graceful shutdown
- Add startup probes for slow-starting services

## Language-Specific Patterns

### Python
```python
# GOOD: Structured logging with context
import structlog
logger = structlog.get_logger()

def process_order(order_id, user_id):
    log = logger.bind(order_id=order_id, user_id=user_id)
    try:
        log.info("processing_order_started")
        # ... business logic
        log.info("processing_order_completed", duration_ms=duration)
    except Exception as e:
        log.error("processing_order_failed", error=str(e), exc_info=True)
        raise

# BAD: Unstructured logging, no context
def process_order(order_id, user_id):
    try:
        print("Processing order")
        # ... business logic
    except:
        pass  # Silent failure
```

### Java
```java
// GOOD: Structured logging with MDC
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.MDC;

public void processOrder(String orderId, String userId) {
    MDC.put("orderId", orderId);
    MDC.put("userId", userId);
    try {
        logger.info("Processing order started");
        // ... business logic
        logger.info("Processing order completed");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        logger.error("Processing order failed", e);
        throw e;
    } finally {
        MDC.clear();
    }
}

// BAD: No context, generic logging
public void processOrder(String orderId, String userId) {
    try {
        System.out.println("Processing");
        // ... business logic
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Silent failure
    }
}
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```javascript
// GOOD: Structured logging with Winston
const winston = require('winston');
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  format: winston.format.json(),
  defaultMeta: { service: 'order-service' }
});

async function processOrder(orderId, userId) {
  const log = logger.child({ orderId, userId });
  try {
    log.info('Processing order started');
    // ... business logic
    log.info('Processing order completed', { duration: duration });
  } catch (error) {
    log.error('Processing order failed', { error: error.message, stack: error.stack });
    throw error;
  }
}

// BAD: Console logging, no structure
async function processOrder(orderId, userId) {
  try {
    console.log('Processing order');
    // ... business logic
  } catch (error) {
    // Silent failure
  }
}
```

### Go
```go
// GOOD: Structured logging with zerolog
import "github.com/rs/zerolog/log"

func processOrder(orderID, userID string) error {
    logger := log.With().
        Str("order_id", orderID).
        Str("user_id", userID).
        Logger()
    
    logger.Info().Msg("Processing order started")
    
    if err := doWork(); err != nil {
        logger.Error().Err(err).Msg("Processing order failed")
        return err
    }
    
    logger.Info().Msg("Processing order completed")
    return nil
}

// BAD: fmt.Println, no structure
func processOrder(orderID, userID string) error {
    fmt.Println("Processing order")
    if err := doWork(); err != nil {
        return err  // No logging
    }
    return nil
}
```

## Analysis Workflow

When analyzing a codebase:

1. **Scan Entry Points**
   - API endpoints/routes
   - Lambda handlers
   - Message queue consumers
   - Scheduled jobs

2. **Identify Critical Paths**
   - Authentication/authorization
   - Payment processing
   - Data mutations
   - External service calls

3. **Check Instrumentation**
   - Logging at entry/exit points
   - Error handling coverage
   - Metrics emission
   - Trace context propagation

4. **Generate Report**
   - List gaps by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Provide code examples for fixes
   - Estimate implementation effort
   - Prioritize recommendations

## Common Observability Gaps

### Critical Gaps
1. **No error logging** - Errors caught but not logged
2. **Missing trace context** - No X-Ray or trace propagation
3. **Silent failures** - Empty catch blocks
4. **No health checks** - Missing /health endpoints
5. **Sensitive data exposure** - PII in logs

### High Priority Gaps

## Performance Monitoring

# Application Signals Performance Monitoring Steering

## Purpose
This steering file provides guidance for using AWS CloudWatch Application Signals to monitor application performance, health, and dependencies.

## Application Signals Overview

Application Signals provides automatic instrumentation for application performance monitoring with:
- **Service-level metrics**: Latency, error rate, request volume
- **Distributed tracing**: End-to-end request flows with X-Ray
- **Service maps**: Visual representation of dependencies
- **SLOs**: Define and track service level objectives
- **Automatic discovery**: No code changes required for common frameworks

## Core Concepts

### 1. Services
A service represents a logical component of your application:
- Microservice
- Lambda function
- API endpoint
- Database connection

### 2. Operations
Operations are specific actions within a service:
- API endpoints
- Database queries
- External service calls
- Message queue operations

### 3. Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
Define expected service performance:
- **Availability SLO**: % of successful requests
- **Latency SLO**: % of requests under threshold
- **Custom SLO**: Based on specific metrics

### 4. Traces
End-to-end view of request flows:
- Trace ID: Unique identifier for request
- Spans: Individual operations within trace
- Annotations: Metadata and custom data
- Subsegments: Nested operations

## Common Monitoring Tasks

### Task 1: View Service Health
Check overall health of a service:

```
Operation: List services
Filters: 
  - Time range: Last 1 hour
  - Status: All / Healthy / Degraded / Unhealthy

Metrics to check:
  - Request count
  - Error rate
  - Average latency
  - P99 latency
```

### Task 2: Analyze Service Dependencies
Understand how services interact:

```
Operation: Get service map
Service: [target-service-name]
Time range: Last 24 hours

Look for:
  - Downstream dependencies
  - Upstream callers
  - External services
  - Database connections
  - Bottlenecks (high latency links)
```

### Task 3: Investigate Performance Issues
When latency increases or errors spike:

```
1. Check service metrics:
   - Compare current vs baseline latency
   - Identify error rate changes
   - Check request volume

2. Examine traces:
   - Filter by slow traces (p99)
   - Look for common patterns
   - Identify slowest operations

3. Analyze dependencies:
   - Check downstream service health
   - Identify external API issues
   - Review database query performance
```

### Task 4: Set Up SLOs
Define service level objectives:

```
Availability SLO Example:
  - Name: "API Availability"
  - Target: 99.9%
  - Evaluation period: 30 days
  - Metric: Success rate
  - Threshold: statusCode < 500

Latency SLO Example:
  - Name: "API Response Time"
  - Target: 95%
  - Evaluation period: 7 days
  - Metric: Request duration
  - Threshold: duration < 500ms
```

15. **get_enablement_guide**: Step-by-step Application Signals setup instructions

### Target Format Reference

Audit tools require JSON target arrays. Examples:

**All services:**
```json
[{"Type":"service","Data":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"*"}}}]
```

**Wildcard pattern (e.g., payment services):**
```json
[{"Type":"service","Data":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"*payment*"}}}]
```

**Specific service:**
```json
[{"Type":"service","Data":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"checkout-service","Environment":"eks:prod-cluster"}}}]
```

**All SLOs:**
```json
[{"Type":"slo","Data":{"Slo":{"SloName":"*"}}}]
```

**Operation targets (e.g., GET operations, Latency):**
```json
[{"Type":"service_operation","Data":{"ServiceOperation":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"*payment*"},"Operation":"*GET*","MetricType":"Latency"}}}]
```

MetricType options: `Latency`, `Availability`, `Fault`, `Error`

### Auditor Selection Guide

| Scenario | Auditors |
|----------|----------|
| Quick health check | Default (omit parameter) |
| Root cause analysis | `all` |
| SLO breach investigation | `all` |
| Error investigation | `log,trace` |
| Dependency issues | `dependency_metric,trace` |
| Find outlier hosts | `top_contributor,operation_metric` |
| Quota monitoring | `service_quota,operation_metric` |

The 7 auditor types: `slo`, `operation_metric`, `trace`, `log`, `dependency_metric`, `top_contributor`, `service_quota`

### Transaction Search Query Patterns

Use with `search_transaction_spans` (100% sampled, queries `aws/spans` log group):

**Error analysis:**
```
FILTER attributes.aws.local.service = "service-name"
  and attributes.http.status_code >= 400
| STATS count() as error_count by attributes.aws.local.operation
| SORT error_count DESC
| LIMIT 20
```

**Latency analysis:**
```
FILTER attributes.aws.local.service = "service-name"
| STATS avg(duration) as avg_latency,
        pct(duration, 99) as p99_latency
  by attributes.aws.local.operation
| SORT p99_latency DESC
| LIMIT 20
```

**Dependency calls:**
```
FILTER attributes.aws.local.service = "service-name"
| STATS count() as call_count, avg(duration) as avg_latency
  by attributes.aws.remote.service, attributes.aws.remote.operation
| SORT call_count DESC
| LIMIT 20
```

**GenAI token usage:**
```
FILTER attributes.aws.local.service = "service-name"
  and attributes.aws.remote.operation = "InvokeModel"
| STATS sum(attributes.gen_ai.usage.output_tokens) as total_tokens
  by attributes.gen_ai.request.model, bin(1h)
```

### X-Ray Filter Expressions

Use with `query_sampled_traces` (5% sampled):

```
# Faults for a service
service("service-name"){fault = true}

# Slow requests
service("service-name") AND duration > 5

# Specific operation
annotation[aws.local.operation]="GET /api/orders"

# HTTP errors
http.status = 500

# Combined
service("api"){fault = true} AND annotation[aws.local.operation]="POST /checkout"
```

### Pagination (`next_token`) Guidance

Wildcard patterns process services/SLOs in batches (default: 5 per call):
1. First call returns findings + `next_token` if more results exist
2. Continue with same parameters + `next_token` to process remaining
3. Repeat until no `next_token` is returned

### Tool Usage Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Service Health Check
```
1. Audit all services:
   audit_services(
     service_targets='[{"Type":"service","Data":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"*"}}}]'
   )

2. For services with issues, deep dive:
   audit_services(
     service_targets='[{"Type":"service","Data":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"problem-service"}}}]',
     auditors="all"
   )

3. Review findings and follow recommendations
```

#### Pattern 2: Latency Investigation
```
1. Audit operations for latency:
   audit_service_operations(
     operation_targets='[{"Type":"service_operation","Data":{"ServiceOperation":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"service-name"},"Operation":"*","MetricType":"Latency"}}}]'
   )

2. Get detailed metrics:
   query_service_metrics(
     service_name="service-name",
     metric_name="Latency",
     statistic="Average",
     extended_statistic="p99"
   )

3. Search 100% sampled traces for slow requests:
   search_transaction_spans(
     query_string='FILTER attributes.aws.local.service = "service-name"
       | STATS avg(duration) as avg_latency, pct(duration, 99) as p99
         by attributes.aws.local.operation
       | SORT p99 DESC | LIMIT 20'
   )
```

#### Pattern 3: Dependency Analysis
```
1. Audit service with dependency auditor:
   audit_services(
     service_targets='[{"Type":"service","Data":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"service-name"}}}]',
     auditors="dependency_metric,trace"
   )

2. For each dependency, check metrics:
   query_service_metrics(
     service_name="dependency-name",
     metric_name="Latency"
   )
```

#### Pattern 4: SLO Monitoring
```
1. Audit all SLOs:
   audit_slos(
     slo_targets='[{"Type":"slo","Data":{"Slo":{"SloName":"*"}}}]'
   )

2. For breached SLOs, get configuration:
   get_slo(slo_id="breached-slo-name")

3. Deep dive with root cause analysis:
   audit_slos(
     slo_targets='[{"Type":"slo","Data":{"Slo":{"SloName":"breached-slo-name"}}}]',
     auditors="all"
   )
```

## Performance Metrics Reference

### Request Metrics
- **RequestCount**: Total number of requests
- **SuccessCount**: Number of successful requests (statusCode < 400)
- **FaultCount**: Number of server errors (statusCode >= 500)
- **ErrorCount**: Number of client errors (400 <= statusCode < 500)

### Latency Metrics
- **Duration**: Request processing time
- **P50**: 50th percentile latency (median)
- **P90**: 90th percentile latency
- **P95**: 95th percentile latency
- **P99**: 99th percentile latency
- **P99.9**: 99.9th percentile latency

### Rate Metrics
- **ErrorRate**: (ErrorCount / RequestCount) * 100
- **FaultRate**: (FaultCount / RequestCount) * 100
- **SuccessRate**: (SuccessCount / RequestCount) * 100

### Throughput Metrics
- **RequestsPerSecond**: RequestCount / time_window
- **BytesIn**: Incoming payload size
- **BytesOut**: Outgoing response size

## Distributed Tracing Analysis

### Trace Structure
```
Trace (Request ID: abc123)
├── Root Span: API Gateway Request
│   ├── Span: Lambda Execution
│   │   ├── Subsegment: DynamoDB Query
│   │   ├── Subsegment: S3 GetObject
│   │   └── Subsegment: External API Call
│   └── Span: Response Processing
```

### Analyzing Traces

**Look for**:
1. **Long spans**: Operations taking significant time
2. **Sequential calls**: Opportunities for parallelization
3. **Repeated operations**: Caching opportunities
4. **External dependencies**: Third-party service issues
5. **Error spans**: Failed operations and exceptions

**Common Patterns**:

```
Pattern: N+1 Query Problem
└── Multiple sequential database queries
    Solution: Use batch operations or caching

Pattern: Sequential External Calls
└── External API calls in sequence
    Solution: Parallelize independent calls

Pattern: Long Cold Start
└── Lambda initialization taking > 1s
    Solution: Provisioned concurrency or runtime optimization

Pattern: Downstream Service Timeout
└── Waiting for slow dependency
    Solution: Circuit breaker, timeout adjustment
```

## SLO Configuration Best Practices

### Availability SLOs

**Example 1: High-Availability Service**
```
Name: "Critical API Availability"
Target: 99.95%
Evaluation period: 30 days
Metric: (SuccessCount / RequestCount) * 100
Threshold: >= 99.95%

Alert when:
  - SLO at risk: Error budget < 20%
  - SLO breach: < 99.95%
```

**Example 2: Standard Service**
```
Name: "Standard API Availability"
Target: 99.9%
Evaluation period: 7 days
Metric: Success rate
Threshold: >= 99.9%
```

### Latency SLOs

**Example 1: User-Facing API**
```
Name: "API Response Time"
Target: 95% of requests < 500ms
Evaluation period: 7 days
Metric: Duration P95
Threshold: < 500ms

Rationale: Users expect fast responses
```

**Example 2: Background Processing**
```
Name: "Batch Job Latency"
Target: 99% of jobs < 30s
Evaluation period: 30 days
Metric: Duration P99
Threshold: < 30000ms

Rationale: Less critical than user-facing
```

### Custom SLOs

**Example: Data Freshness**
```
Name: "Data Pipeline Freshness"
Target: 99% of updates < 5 minutes old
Evaluation period: 24 hours
Metric: Custom metric (data_age)
Threshold: < 300000ms
```

## Performance Troubleshooting Workflows

### Workflow 1: High Error Rate

**Steps**:
1. Identify service with high error rate
2. Get error breakdown by operation
3. Sample error traces
4. Analyze error patterns:
   - Client errors (4xx): Input validation, auth issues
   - Server errors (5xx): Application bugs, dependency failures
5. Check dependencies for issues
6. Review recent deployments
7. Check CloudWatch Logs for detailed error messages

**Logs Insights Query for Error Analysis**:
```
# Analyze errors by endpoint and status code
fields @timestamp, endpoint, statusCode, errorType
| filter statusCode >= 400
| stats count(*) as errorCount by endpoint, statusCode
| sort errorCount desc
| limit 20
```

### Workflow 2: Increased Latency

**Steps**:
1. Compare current P95/P99 vs baseline
2. Identify slow operations
3. Analyze slow traces:
   - Which spans are slowest?
   - Are downstream services slow?
   - Database query performance?
4. Check for:
   - Increased load (scale out)
   - Code changes (rollback if needed)
   - Dependency issues (circuit breaker)
   - Resource constraints (CPU, memory)
5. Correlate with Application Signals service map

**Logs Insights Query for Latency Analysis**:
```
# Analyze latency by endpoint
fields @timestamp, endpoint, duration
| filter ispresent(duration)
| stats count(*) as requestCount, 
        avg(duration) as avgDuration,
        pct(duration, 95) as p95,
        pct(duration, 99) as p99,
        max(duration) as maxDuration 
  by endpoint
| sort p95 desc
| limit 20
```

### Workflow 3: SLO Breach Investigation

**Steps**:
1. Identify which SLO was breached
2. Determine time of breach
3. Get metrics during breach period:
   - Error rate spike?
   - Latency increase?
   - Traffic surge?
4. Check for correlated events:
   - Deployments (CloudTrail - use data source priority)
   - Infrastructure changes
   - Dependency failures
5. Review traces from breach period
6. Document root cause
7. Update runbooks

## Integration with Other Observability Tools

### CloudWatch Logs
Use Logs Insights queries to correlate Application Signals metrics with logs:

```
# Find slow requests with trace correlation
fields @timestamp, @message, requestId, traceId, duration, level
| filter duration > 1000
| sort duration desc
| limit 100
```

### CloudTrail
Check for recent changes that might affect performance:
```
Follow CloudTrail data source priority (see cloudtrail-data-source-selection.md):
1. Check CloudTrail Lake event data stores (preferred)
2. Check CloudWatch Logs for CloudTrail integration
3. Use CloudTrail Lookup Events API (fallback)

Query for:
- Recent deployments
- Configuration changes
- IAM policy updates
- Resource modifications
```

### X-Ray
Deep dive into specific traces:
```
1. Get trace IDs from Application Signals
2. Open X-Ray console for detailed analysis
3. Review service map and trace timeline
4. Check for errors and exceptions
5. Examine annotations and metadata
```

## Alerting Configuration

### Critical Alerts

**High Error Rate**:
```
Metric: ErrorRate
Threshold: > 5%
Evaluation period: 5 minutes
Datapoints to alarm: 3 of 5
Action: Page on-call engineer
```

**P99 Latency Breach**:
```
Metric: Duration P99
Threshold: > 2000ms
Evaluation period: 10 minutes
Datapoints to alarm: 2 of 2
Action: Notify team channel
```

**SLO At Risk**:
```
Metric: Error budget remaining
Threshold: < 20%
Evaluation period: 1 hour
Action: Notify team, consider feature freeze
```

### Warning Alerts

**Elevated Error Rate**:
```
Metric: ErrorRate
Threshold: > 1%
Evaluation period: 15 minutes
Action: Notify team channel
```

**P95 Latency Increase**:
```
Metric: Duration P95
Threshold: > 1000ms
Evaluation period: 15 minutes
Action: Log to monitoring channel
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Service Instrumentation
- Use AWS X-Ray SDK for custom instrumentation
- Add meaningful service names
- Include environment in service name (e.g., "api-prod")
- Use consistent naming conventions

### 2. SLO Management
- Start with realistic targets (99% before 99.99%)
- Align SLOs with business requirements
- Review and adjust quarterly
- Track error budget consumption
- Plan for error budget-based decisions

### 3. Trace Sampling
- Use adaptive sampling for high-volume services
- Always capture error traces
- Sample 100% of traces during incidents
- Include custom annotations for business context

### 4. Metric Collection
- Monitor latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- Track error rates by type (4xx vs 5xx)
- Measure request volume trends
- Monitor dependency health

### 5. Performance Baselines
- Establish normal latency baselines
- Document expected error rates
- Track seasonal patterns
- Update baselines after optimization

## Common Performance Patterns

### Pattern 1: Cold Start Impact
**Symptom**: High P99 latency, spiky performance
**Detection**: Large gap between P50 and P99
**Solution**: Provisioned concurrency, keep-alive strategies

### Pattern 2: Database Connection Pooling
**Symptom**: Latency increases with load
**Detection**: Slow database spans in traces
**Solution**: Connection pooling, query optimization

### Pattern 3: Cascading Failures
**Symptom**: Multiple services showing errors simultaneously
**Detection**: Service map shows downstream failures
**Solution**: Circuit breakers, timeout configuration, bulkheads

### Pattern 4: Cache Invalidation
**Symptom**: Periodic latency spikes
**Detection**: Traces show increased database/API calls
**Solution**: Optimize cache strategy, cache warming

### Pattern 5: Traffic Bursts
**Symptom**: Error rate increases during peak load
**Detection**: Correlation between RequestCount and ErrorRate
**Solution**: Auto-scaling, rate limiting, queue buffering

## Quick Reference Commands

### Get Service Health
```
1. audit_services(service_targets='[{"Type":"service","Data":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"*"}}}]')
2. query_service_metrics(service_name="service-name", metric_name="Latency")
```

### Investigate Slow Request
```
1. search_transaction_spans(query_string='FILTER attributes.aws.local.service = "service-name" and duration > 5000 | LIMIT 20')
2. Analyze span durations from results
```

### Check Dependencies
```
1. audit_services(service_targets='[{"Type":"service","Data":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"service-name"}}}]', auditors="dependency_metric,trace")
```

### Monitor SLO
```
1. audit_slos(slo_targets='[{"Type":"slo","Data":{"Slo":{"SloName":"*"}}}]')
2. get_slo(slo_id="slo-name")
3. If breached: audit_slos(slo_targets='[{"Type":"slo","Data":{"Slo":{"SloName":"slo-name"}}}]', auditors="all")
```

---

**Remember**: Application Signals works best when services are properly instrumented and SLOs are aligned with business requirements. Always correlate metrics with traces and logs for complete visibility.

## Security Auditing

# CloudTrail Security Auditing Steering

## Purpose
This steering file provides guidance for accessing and analyzing CloudTrail audit data for security auditing, compliance monitoring, and governance analysis.

## Prerequisites and Data Source Selection

**IMPORTANT**: CloudTrail audit data can be accessed through multiple sources. Always follow the priority order defined in `cloudtrail-data-source-selection.md`:

### Priority 1: CloudTrail Lake (Preferred)
Check first for CloudTrail Lake event data stores using the CloudTrail MCP server:
- Use `list_event_data_stores` to check for enabled event data stores
- If available, use `lake_query` for SQL-based analysis
- Best for complex queries, long-term retention (7 years), and cost efficiency

### Priority 2: CloudWatch Logs (If CloudTrail Lake not available)
Check for CloudTrail integration with CloudWatch Logs:
- Use `describe_log_groups` to look for log groups containing "cloudtrail" in the name
- Common patterns: `/aws/cloudtrail/logs`, `/aws/cloudtrail/<trail-name>`, `CloudTrail/logs`
- Use `execute_log_insights_query` for CloudWatch Logs Insights analysis
- Good for real-time monitoring and CloudWatch Alarms integration

### Priority 3: CloudTrail Lookup Events API (Fallback)
If neither CloudTrail Lake nor CloudWatch Logs available:
- Use `lookup_events` from CloudTrail MCP server
- Limited to last 90 days of events
- Basic filtering with LookupAttributes
- Good for quick lookups but limited query capabilities

**See `cloudtrail-data-source-selection.md` for detailed decision tree and implementation workflow.**

## When to Load This Steering
Load this when the user needs to:
- Investigate security incidents
- Track API activity and resource changes
- Perform compliance audits
- Monitor IAM changes
- Detect unauthorized access attempts
- Generate audit reports
- Correlate security events with application logs

## CloudTrail Overview

CloudTrail provides governance, compliance, and audit capabilities by logging all API calls in your AWS account. When integrated with CloudWatch Logs, you can:

- **Real-time Analysis**: Query events as they arrive
- **CloudWatch Logs Insights**: Use powerful query syntax for complex analysis
- **Cross-Service Correlation**: Correlate CloudTrail events with application logs
- **Long-term Retention**: Configure retention policies in CloudWatch Logs
- **Multi-Region Support**: Capture events across all regions
- **Multi-Account Support**: Aggregate logs from organization

## Core Concepts

### Event Types

**1. Management Events**
- Control plane operations
- Resource creation, modification, deletion
- IAM changes
- Security group modifications
- Examples: CreateBucket, RunInstances, CreateUser

**2. Data Events**
- Data plane operations
- S3 object-level operations
- Lambda function invocations
- DynamoDB table operations
- Examples: GetObject, PutObject, Invoke

**3. Insights Events**
- Unusual API activity detected by ML
- Rate-based anomalies
- Error rate anomalies
- Requires CloudTrail Insights enabled

### Event Structure

CloudTrail events in CloudWatch Logs contain these key fields:

```json
{
  "eventTime": "2024-12-08T10:30:00Z",
  "eventName": "CreateBucket",
  "eventSource": "s3.amazonaws.com",
  "userIdentity": {
    "type": "IAMUser",
    "principalId": "AIDAI...",
    "arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/alice",
    "userName": "alice"
  },
  "sourceIPAddress": "203.0.113.0",
  "userAgent": "aws-cli/2.0.0",
  "requestParameters": {
    "bucketName": "my-new-bucket"
  },
  "responseElements": {
    "location": "https://my-new-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/"
  },
  "errorCode": null,
  "errorMessage": null
}
```

## Querying CloudTrail Data

### Using CloudTrail Lake (Priority 1)

When CloudTrail Lake event data store is available, use SQL-based queries:

**Tool**: `lake_query` from CloudTrail MCP server

**Example Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    eventTime,
    eventName,
    userIdentity.userName,
    sourceIPAddress,
    requestParameters
FROM <event_data_store_id>
WHERE eventName IN ('DeleteBucket', 'TerminateInstances')
    AND eventTime > timestamp '2024-01-01 00:00:00'
ORDER BY eventTime DESC
LIMIT 50
```

**Advantages**:
- Full SQL support with JOINs, aggregations, and window functions
- 7-year retention by default
- Cross-account and cross-region queries
- Cost-effective for large-scale analysis
- Advanced filtering and partitioning

### Using CloudWatch Logs (Priority 2)

When CloudTrail is integrated with CloudWatch Logs:

**Tool**: `execute_log_insights_query` from CloudWatch MCP server

**Example Query:**
```
fields eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName, sourceIPAddress, requestParameters
| filter eventName = "DeleteBucket" or eventName = "TerminateInstances"
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 50
```

**Query Parameters:**
```
- log_group_names: ["/aws/cloudtrail/logs"]  # Or your CloudTrail log group name
- query_string: CloudWatch Logs Insights query (see above)
- start_time: ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z")
- end_time: ISO 8601 format
- limit: 50 (or as needed)
```

**Advantages**:
- Real-time event streaming
- CloudWatch Alarms integration
- Cross-service log correlation
- Familiar CloudWatch interface

### Using Lookup Events API (Priority 3 - Fallback)

When neither CloudTrail Lake nor CloudWatch Logs available:

**Tool**: `lookup_events` from CloudTrail MCP server

**Example Usage:**
```
lookup_events(
    LookupAttributes=[
        {
            'AttributeKey': 'EventName',
            'AttributeValue': 'DeleteBucket'
        }
    ],
    StartTime='2024-01-01T00:00:00Z',
    EndTime='2024-12-31T23:59:59Z',
    MaxResults=50
)
```

**Limitations**:
- Only last 90 days of events
- Limited to 50 results per API call
- Basic filtering capabilities
- No SQL or complex query support

#### Pattern 2: Security Incident Investigation

| filter userIdentity.userName = "suspect-user"
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 100

# 3. Check IAM changes before incident
fields eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName, requestParameters
| filter eventSource = "iam.amazonaws.com"
| filter eventName like /Create|Delete|Update|Attach|Detach/
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 50
```


#### Pattern 3: Compliance Audit
```
# 1. List all IAM changes

| limit 100

# 3. Review resource deletions
fields eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName, requestParameters, responseElements
| filter eventName like /Delete|Terminate/
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 100
```

#### Pattern 4: Resource Change Tracking
```
# 1. Find specific resource changes (replace with actual resource ARN)
fields eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName, requestParameters, responseElements
| filter requestParameters like /arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 50

# 2. Track configuration changes for a service
fields eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName, requestParameters
| filter eventSource = "ec2.amazonaws.com"
| filter eventName like /Update|Modify|Put/
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 100
```

## Security Monitoring Use Cases

```


## Incident Investigation Workflows

### Workflow 1: Suspicious IAM Activity

**Scenario**: Alert for unusual IAM activity

**Investigation Steps**:

1. **Identify the event**:
   ```
   fields eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName, requestParameters, sourceIPAddress
   | filter eventSource = "iam.amazonaws.com"
   | sort eventTime desc
   | limit 100
   ```

2. **Trace user activity**:
   ```
   # Trace all activity for suspect user
   fields eventTime, eventName, eventSource, sourceIPAddress, userAgent
   | filter userIdentity.userName = "suspect-user"
   | sort eventTime asc
   | limit 500
   ```

3. **Check for privilege escalation**:
   ```
   # Check for privilege escalation attempts
   fields eventTime, eventName, requestParameters.policyDocument as policy, requestParameters
   | filter userIdentity.userName = "suspect-user"
   | filter eventName in ["CreatePolicy", "AttachUserPolicy", "PutUserPolicy", "AttachRolePolicy", "PutRolePolicy"]
   | sort eventTime asc
   | limit 100
   ```

4. **Identify affected resources**:
   ```
   # Find resources accessed by suspect user
   fields eventName, eventSource, requestParameters
   | filter userIdentity.userName = "suspect-user"
   | stats count() as accessCount by eventName, eventSource
   | sort accessCount desc
   | limit 100
   ```

5. **Check access key usage**:
   ```
   fields eventTime, eventName, requestParameters.userName as targetUser, requestParameters.accessKeyId
   | filter eventName = "CreateAccessKey"
   | filter userIdentity.userName = "suspect-user" or requestParameters.userName = "suspect-user"
   | sort eventTime desc
   | limit 50
   ```

### Workflow 2: Resource Deletion Investigation

**Scenario**: Critical resource was deleted

**Investigation Steps**:

1. **Find the deletion event**:
   ```
   fields eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName, requestParameters, sourceIPAddress
   | filter eventName like /Delete|Terminate/
   | sort eventTime desc
   | limit 100
   ```

2. **Identify who deleted it**:
   ```
   fields eventTime, userIdentity.userName, userIdentity.principalId, userIdentity.arn, sourceIPAddress, userAgent
   | filter eventName = "DeleteBucket"  # Replace with actual deletion event
   | filter requestParameters.bucketName = "my-critical-bucket"  # Replace with actual resource
   | sort eventTime desc
   | limit 10
   ```

3. **Check user's recent activity**:
   ```
   fields eventTime, eventName, eventSource, sourceIPAddress
   | filter userIdentity.userName = "user-who-deleted"
   | filter eventName in ["ConsoleLogin", "GetSessionToken", "AssumeRole"]
   | sort eventTime desc
   | limit 10
   ```

4. **Check for automation**:
   ```
   fields eventTime, userAgent, sourceIPAddress
   | filter userIdentity.userName = "user-who-deleted"
   | stats count() as eventCount by userAgent
   | sort eventCount desc
   ```
   Look at userAgent field:
   - `aws-cli/*` indicates CLI usage
   - `Boto3/*` indicates Python SDK usage
   - `aws-sdk-*` indicates SDK usage
   - Check if expected for this user

### Workflow 3: Compliance Audit

**Scenario**: Quarterly compliance audit

**Audit Tasks**:

1. **IAM User Audit**:
   ```
   # List all users created in the audit period
   fields eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName as creator, requestParameters.userName as newUser
   | filter eventName = "CreateUser"
   | sort eventTime asc
   | limit 500
   ```

2. **Access Key Rotation**:
   ```
   # Find access keys created in the audit period
   fields eventTime, requestParameters.userName as user, responseElements.accessKey.accessKeyId as keyId
   | filter eventName = "CreateAccessKey"
   | sort eventTime asc
   | limit 500
   ```

3. **Policy Changes**:
   ```
   # Track policy modifications
   fields eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName as actor, requestParameters.policyName as policy
   | filter eventName in ["CreatePolicy", "CreatePolicyVersion", "DeletePolicy", "DeletePolicyVersion"]
   | sort eventTime asc
   | limit 500
   ```

4. **Encryption Changes**:
   ```
   # Track KMS key operations
   fields eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName as user, requestParameters.keyId as keyId
   | filter eventSource = "kms.amazonaws.com"
   | filter eventName in ["CreateKey", "ScheduleKeyDeletion", "DisableKey", "EnableKeyRotation"]
   | sort eventTime asc
   | limit 500
   ```

## Security Alerting Patterns

### Critical Alerts

**1. Root Account Usage**
```
# Alert: Root account activity
fields eventTime, eventName, sourceIPAddress, userIdentity.sessionContext.attributes.mfaAuthenticated as mfaUsed
| filter userIdentity.type = "Root"
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 50
```
**Action**: Page security team immediately

**2. IAM Policy Modifications**
```
# Alert: IAM policy modifications
fields eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName as user, requestParameters.policyDocument as policy, requestParameters
| filter eventName in ["PutUserPolicy", "PutRolePolicy", "AttachUserPolicy", "AttachRolePolicy"]
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 50
```
**Action**: Review policy changes, alert if suspicious

**3. Security Group Opening to Internet**
```
# Alert: Security group opened to 0.0.0.0/0
fields eventTime, userIdentity.userName as user, requestParameters
| filter eventName = "AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress"
| filter requestParameters like /0.0.0.0\/0/
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 50
```
**Action**: Verify business justification

**4. KMS Key Deletion Scheduled**
```
# Alert: KMS key scheduled for deletion
fields eventTime, userIdentity.userName as user, requestParameters.keyId as keyId
| filter eventName = "ScheduleKeyDeletion"
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 50
```
**Action**: Confirm key is no longer needed

## Cross-Service Correlation

### Correlate CloudTrail with Application Logs

One of the key advantages of using CloudWatch Logs for CloudTrail is the ability to correlate security events with application behavior. While CloudWatch Logs Insights doesn't support JOINs across log groups in a single query, you can:

1. **Query CloudTrail for security events**
2. **Extract timestamps and user information**
3. **Query application logs for the same time period**
4. **Correlate results manually or programmatically**

**Example Workflow**:
```
# Step 1: Find IAM policy changes
fields eventTime, eventName, userIdentity.userName, requestParameters
| filter eventSource = "iam.amazonaws.com"
| filter eventName like /Policy/
| sort eventTime desc
| limit 50

# Step 2: Use the timestamps from above to query application logs
# Query application logs for errors after the policy change time
fields @timestamp, level, message
| filter level = "ERROR"
| filter @timestamp > "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"  # Use timestamp from Step 1
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 100
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Trail Configuration
- Enable CloudTrail in all regions
- Enable for all accounts (AWS Organizations)
- Enable log file validation
- **Configure CloudTrail to send events to CloudWatch Logs**
- Set up S3 lifecycle policies for cost optimization

### 2. Monitoring
- Set up CloudWatch Alarms for critical events
- Create metric filters for suspicious patterns
- Regular review of CloudTrail Insights
- Automate response to known threats
- Use CloudWatch Logs Insights for real-time analysis

### 3. Analysis
- Use CloudWatch Logs Insights for complex queries
- Correlate CloudTrail with application logs using time-based analysis
- Build CloudWatch Dashboards for security metrics
- Regular audit log reviews with saved queries

### 4. Retention
- Configure CloudWatch Logs retention for CloudTrail log groups
- Keep CloudTrail logs for required compliance period
- Consider separate retention for security events
- Archive to S3/Glacier for cost optimization
- Ensure immutability (S3 Object Lock for S3 archives)

### 5. Access Control
- Restrict access to CloudTrail log groups
- Use IAM policies to control CloudWatch Logs access
- Enable CloudWatch Logs encryption
- Monitor access to CloudTrail logs using CloudTrail itself

## Quick Reference

### Common Event Names
- **IAM**: CreateUser, DeleteUser, AttachUserPolicy, CreateAccessKey
- **EC2**: RunInstances, TerminateInstances, AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress
- **S3**: CreateBucket, DeleteBucket, PutBucketPolicy
- **RDS**: CreateDBInstance, DeleteDBInstance, ModifyDBInstance
- **Lambda**: CreateFunction, DeleteFunction, UpdateFunctionCode

### User Identity Types
- **IAMUser**: Standard IAM user
- **AssumedRole**: Assumed role via STS
- **Root**: Root account
- **FederatedUser**: Federated identity
- **AWSService**: AWS service acting on your behalf

### Error Codes
- **AccessDenied**: Permission denied
- **UnauthorizedOperation**: Not authorized for operation
- **InvalidParameter**: Invalid request parameter
- **ResourceNotFound**: Resource doesn't exist

### Common CloudWatch Logs Insights Filters

```
# Filter by event source
| filter eventSource = "iam.amazonaws.com"

# Filter by event name pattern
| filter eventName like /Delete|Terminate/

# Filter by user
| filter userIdentity.userName = "specific-user"

# Filter by error codes
| filter errorCode in ["AccessDenied", "UnauthorizedOperation"]

# Filter by IP address
| filter sourceIPAddress = "203.0.113.0"

# Filter by time range (in query, not tool parameters)
| filter eventTime > "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
```

TypeScript's value is proportional to how seriously you take it. These rules keep the type system useful rather than decorative.

## Strictness baseline

Always enable `strict: true`. It subsumes `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `strictFunctionTypes`, and others. If a codebase has `strict: false`, treat every type annotation as a suggestion, not a guarantee.

## Prefer explicit over inferred at boundaries

Infer freely inside functions. Be explicit at:
- Function return types on exported functions
- Public class properties
- Anything that crosses a module or API boundary

```typescript
// ✓ — inferred internally, explicit at boundary
export function parseVersion(raw: string): Version {
  const parts = raw.split('.').map(Number);
  return { major: parts[0], minor: parts[1], patch: parts[2] };
}
```

## Never reach for `any`

`any` is an escape hatch that silences the compiler without fixing anything.

- Use `unknown` when the type genuinely isn't known yet — it forces you to narrow before use
- Use `satisfies` to validate a value against a type while preserving a narrower inferred type
- Use generics when the type varies but the shape is consistent

## Discriminated unions over optional fields

Optional fields suggest "sometimes this exists" — discriminated unions make the condition explicit and exhaustion-checkable.

```typescript
// ✗
interface Result { data?: Data; error?: string; }

// ✓
type Result =
  | { ok: true;  data: Data }
  | { ok: false; error: string };
```

## `as` is a smell

A type assertion (`value as Foo`) overrides the compiler. Use it only when you have information the compiler cannot — e.g. after a runtime check that TypeScript can't see. Document why with a comment.

## Utility types as vocabulary

Know `Partial<T>`, `Required<T>`, `Readonly<T>`, `Pick<T, K>`, `Omit<T, K>`, `Record<K, V>`, `ReturnType<F>`, `Parameters<F>`, and `Extract`/`Exclude`. Using them signals intent and stays in sync with the base type automatically.

# Implementation Plan: Rosetta Stone

## Overview

Implement Rosetta Stone in TypeScript as a Zod-validated functional core with an imperative Bun/Commander shell. The sequence establishes public schemas and registry invariants first, then detection and canonical translation, built-in source and target translators, safe orchestration, CLI/configuration, compatibility facades, sync integration, generated operational guidance, and release validation. Each implementation step builds on an earlier contract and ends with the existing Kanon interfaces wired to the new subsystem.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Establish Rosetta Stone public schemas and deterministic contracts
  - [x] 1.1 Add the strict Rosetta Stone Zod schemas and inferred TypeScript types to `src/schemas.ts`
    - Define identifiers, versions, source documents, format contracts, compatibility profiles, requests, diagnostics, plans, profiles, results, and machine-output envelopes.

  - [x] 1.2 Create `src/rosetta/contracts.ts` and deterministic normalization utilities
    - Re-export schema-derived interfaces and implement code-point ordering, stable JSON/YAML ordering inputs, canonical comparison normalization, deep freezing, and immutable context types.
    - Keep all public data shapes owned by `src/schemas.ts` and make pure contracts independent of filesystem, process, clock, random, Git, and network state.
    - _Requirements: 5.6, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.6, 12.7_
  - [x] 1.3 Implement structured diagnostics in `src/rosetta/diagnostics.ts`
    - Add trusted diagnostic factories, blocking-code metadata, source/canonical locations, deterministic sorting, safe internal-error conversion, and the `RegistryFailure` fallback.

- [ ] 20. Final checkpoint - Ensure all tests pass
  - Ensure all tests pass, ask the user if questions arise.

## Notes

- Implementation language is TypeScript (ESNext) on Bun; schemas use Zod 4, CLI commands use Commander, templates use in-memory Nunjucks, and generated properties use fast-check 4.x.
- Tasks marked with `*` are optional test tasks and may be skipped for a faster implementation pass; core implementation tasks are never optional.
- Every property task corresponds to exactly one numbered correctness property, uses the exact design comment annotation, runs at least 100 cases, and leaves fast-check shrinking output unchanged.
- Unit, integration, regression, architecture-boundary, and property suites use one-shot `bun test` execution, never watch mode.
- Validation runs from `kanon/`: `bun test src/__tests__/rosetta-*.test.ts`, `bun test`, `bun x tsc --noEmit`, and `bun run lint`.

Reconciliation (task group 19) depends on the canonical serializer (task 4), the source translators and import path (task groups 6, 14), and the sync orchestrator integration (task group 16); its schemas (19.1) can land alongside the other schema work but its core and orchestration follow those prerequisites. Task 20 is the renumbered final checkpoint.
